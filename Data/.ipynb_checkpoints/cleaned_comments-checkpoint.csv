It was 3 years ago
Overall it&#39;s a perfect masterpiece<br>I was expecting they bring back Harry osborn :)
I managed to get a tenth of the way through this film. What a load of boring crap!
"I still remember when this trailer was released 3 years ago, people in the comment section were all making their theory to prove that Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire are also in the movie !😂Damn it&#39;s already 3 years"
Who’s here for brand new day?
Spider-Man 4 Coming 2026
Almost been 3 years
"3 years ago I was in an online class and this droped,the next second itself I clicked this😂"
Remember when we still gave a shit about Marvel
Tobey ❤. Man seeing Tobey brings so much tears in my eyes.
This might be Marvels greatest film and ANY franchise film for that matter. The way all the spiderman movies was unintentionally tied into eachother via the multiverse resurrecting all the old villains and spidermen was insane . Hats off to the writers who conjured this up .
I am gonna leave this comment for my kids
Who is here after the movie
"Such an overrated movie, relies too much on nostalgia"
Still gives me chills
3 years ago already?😢
Imagine if it was Bully maguire version of Tobey&#39;s(black suit) that was dragged into the verse.<br><br> It would have been diabolical!
3 years no Spider-man movie 🥹
Take me back 😢😢
Hey…
"After 3 years, the trailer still creates the same feeling in me"
Who got this recommended?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=141"">2:21</a> This was always remain the best shot in the entire trailer cause it proved it all...we were right about them being in this"
I remember the hype in the tobey and andrew scene in the cinema
"heriones from other universes know that peter is Spiderman, Why didn&#39;t they come back 😢"
Hard to believe it’s been three years since the Lizard was punched by nothing.
3 years have passed and it feels like it was yesterday...
Time flies man.
Its been 3 years time flies wheres spider man 4
i refuse to believe this was three years ago time is going too fast 😭
Remember when this trailer broke the internet?
I wanna time travel and see this movie in December again in theaters again and it became the best Spider-Man movie I ever saw in cinema history.
hollllyyyyy CRAP this is gonna be SO GOOD (im a frickin nerd)
3 years of no way home ❤
"3 year anniversary of this trailer, damn time sure does fly when your life is falling apart"
Spider-Man 3: Turning Point for a Better Marvel Cinematic Universe Reboot would show Norman Osborn/Green Goblin as the main villain looking 100% like the comics/1994 Animated Series just like Gwen Stacy would die. Also at the end of the movie Norman Osborn ends up in a Coma and Harry vows to get revenge on Spider-Man.
No way it&#39;s been 3 years already
3 years since this brilliant trailer
3 years have gone by and yet this feels like yesterday! 😢❤
3 years
Someone needs to stop time <br>Man
Wow 3 years ago today this trailer was released.
Happy 3th years Trailer!
3 Years
3 Years.....<br>I woke up at 3 AM just to watch this trailer 😭
This was the last marvel movie with real hype
WHO COOKED WITH THIS SOUNDTRACK
This movie created more hype than Endgame
"I haven&#39;t seen the movie and it&#39;s been two years since it was released, although I can tell the glove that catches mj is different from tom&#39;s so that is obviously andrew or toby and also the lizard got kicked in the face from nothing so they obviously tried removing them, and I peiced it together andrew cathes mj and kicks lizard, this took a whole day to figure out by comparing them and lightening the frame, and andrew is the only one that can move his back like that cus he isn&#39;t as old as toby, but nice try sony!"
Venom 4:New Reborn movie is officially releasing soon in 2026.
All the Sony super hero movies are crucial for super heroes lovers
"Damn, got recommended after almost 3 yrs. I miss the hype"
Whos here after homecuming
Wait. Green Goblin and dock ock from Raimi verse is here?? I wish Tobey and Andrew will follow :(
"Christmas is coming next month, so I figured I’d buy this movie on Vudu as my Christmas present"
When Will This Materpiece Add On Disney+
This movie was so good honestly because of the cameos and the old villains coming back
It&#39;s almost 3 years ago..
"It would have been a masterpiece if they added bully maguire, venom or Rhino"
Venom The Last Dance Is Out Now!
Marvel should have all rights to spider-man
Hype of Endgame ✅<br>Hype of No Way Home ✅ 🔥
This was such a good movie
bro marvel managed to hide the other spiderman
"Did anyone else forget Tobey and Andrew were NOT in the trailer while watching this, and then thought where are they?😂😂"
Electro: You’re not gonna take this away from me<br><br>Electro was so much more awesome in this movie then he was in TAS2
This was such a great movie
I kinda wish Andrew Garfield refused this movie just to get back at them for doing him dirty with the Spider-Man franchise. They must’ve offered him a lot of money
"Just saw the TASM 2 Trailer Casually and realised NWH trailer and TASM 2 Trailer is so Similar, the theme the Bgm it&#39;s almost the same 🫡"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=137"">2:17</a> They hide smartly"
shes so fast
Biggest regret of not watching in theatres coz of COVID 😢
Only good marvel movie after endgame and we all know why😅
they hid the three spidermen well
God I miss this era 😊❤
"Can’t wait for, <br>Spiderman: Forgotten Home!"
"Doctor Strange: We started getting some visitors... from every universe.🦸🏻‍♂️🦹🏻‍♂️<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=35"">0:35</a>"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=100"">1:40</a> but thats bullshite, they dont all die fighting Spiderman. Sandman walks off into the sunset, Dr Connors ends up in prison. All the rest die, but not all."
"Search up &quot;3 Dev Adam&quot;, would have been wild if they had incorporated that into this spider-verse as well😂"
Anyone here after Tony is casted after Dr doom😅
"you just had to be there, from the trailer release to the movie itself... you just had to be there, 3 generation of spider man, didyouknowhowlongwevewaitedforthis?"
Did this not come out in 2021
I believe Peter Parker brought Tony Stark as Evil Doom in the spark dimension in No way home and in the Next coming New Movie of spiderman will gives us spoiler for THE DOOM the movie.
My god the acting so cringe  tf
"Peter : Stephen, I need your help.<br>Dr. : you want me to cast a spell, so that everyone forget you are spidey .<br>Peter : Nope ,  cast a spell so that everyone forget what mysterio said.<br>Dr : Shit ....,   This boy is a genius."
It’s been 2 years 😢
the beast on the way to rome itay
"I just saw this movie for the first time and just because toby and andrew along with their villians see in it i loved it , although i thot the plot was awful and they should have made it more realistic and toby darker because toby doent play around , he will end you."
"Rewatching this, let’s be honest. We all thought Tom was gonna have a 1v3 moment"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=152"">2:32</a> history will remake 💔 please not this time we can’t loose her 😭"
Nobody is going to forget

Who is here after venom 3🔥
Tom Holland spiderman was the most stupid and brainless spiderman
I cant believe it has been 2 years. Still feel the fresh vibes as 2 years ago. how quickly time flies but memories remain fresh
"I&#39;m so upset they got cured. Spiderman NEEDS Doc Oc, he NEEDS Green Goblin. Now, if they were to ever appear again, Peter will be just too aware of these people and their intentions. I wish it was a slow burn. I wish Doc Oc or Norman was in the first film as a good guy, maybe a different actor. Just so we could see how Peter reacts to these people he grew up with might change if he ISN&#39;T Spider-Man."
"Holy yeah, I still cannot believe ts film is real😭"
"Here after Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, the best Marvel movie since this one."
Who&#39;s here after shang chi director going to direct spider man 4
its been 2 years
Time passed fast for this one.
shout out to the Lizard for being a giveaway that the other Spider-Men were gonna be in the movie
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=61"">1:01</a> How are we supposed to take your villain seriously if your <i>own film</i> doesn&#39;t?"
Now Trailer 2<br>Sonic Movie 3 <br>November
"Making Miles Morales Spider-Man film in the Multiverse Saga Miles Morales&#39;s Spider-Man film in Tobey Maguire Spider-Man Universe in which Death of Tobey Spider-Man,Miles Morales Spider-Man Release After Avengers:Secret Wars &amp; Death of Tobey &amp; Andrew as mentor"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=139"">2:19</a> the other two Peter Parker&#39;s are edited out like the theory about sonic movie 3 trailer that there is Amy edited out of it."

"Sometimes I agree with martin scorsese with these films being themepark films 😂😅<br>We need to get over it ASAP and make original films, beat it 💯"
I miss the era 🥺
The hype this movie had though
"Everytime a movie makes me both laugh and shed tears, it is considered a great one for me! This one did. I really like the part where the 3 spiderman characters are united and the subsequent parts, especially when they go find Peter who is mourning on top of tower and when they are in the lab together. The ending, starting let say with the part where Dr Strange tells Peter people will forget him to the moment Zendaya says to peter  &#39;&#39;I love you&#39;&#39; only with her lips from a distance touches me deeply every time I watch...This is my best movie from the Spiderman movie serie....Very entertaining!"

Who&#39;s here because they just wanted to watch this trailer without being annoyed by comments like this?
This was when the endgame hype came back
"(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=134"">2:14</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=141"">2:21</a>) 2 Years Man and I was in middle school when this happen bro like, I miss the biggest hype ever like these 2 parts made me hype as hell because it was such a good time to see the old villains of Spider-Man coming back especially sandman. Like literally after watching Deadpool &amp; Wolverine this was the best thing ever."
I miss this movie hype
what happened to the new goblin/goblin jr? he kind of just didn’t exist in this movie. or maybe it was because the green goblin was already the biggest threat?
I watch Spider man No way home in Netflix and It&#39;s a very great movie ❤❤😊
Future  generations  won&#39;t  understand  thr excitment this movie gave us
"I get the hype right now, didn’t now about the script🤯"
This movie is just perfect and I can&#39;t explain the hype in words and even after watching Deadpool and wolverine this much of feeling I didn&#39;t got . I also remembered that watching all empire movie pics breakdown trailer 1 2 breakdown videos in more than 20 channels for a complete day .... Just WOW yeah definitely upcoming movies will have the same level of hype but this movie&#39;s hype is more special next to endgame
Anyone watching this after it was announced Robert Downey Jr. is Dr. Doom?
&#39;Strong enough to have it all.. to weak to take!&quot;
This is one of them “ you had to be there” moments!
"This was two years ago...<br><br><br><br>Time flies fast, don&#39;t it."
been a while
The hype for this movie was just…oml the theaters was just everywhere imma say that rn…
The greatest spider-man movie of the all time.
Anyone after knowing RDJ as Dr. DOOM ?!?
You had to be there…the hype with the three spider-man’s possibility was crazy. I miss those days.
Good Old times 🙂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=155"">2:35</a> So they did leave a hint lol"
this movie was a banger
Just came back to experience the hype 😂❤ again
2 years...
"Remember when people were having full blown arguments about whether Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield were gonna be in this movie, I miss that time"
you just had to be there..
Anyone still here in 2024? I miss the hype of this movie especially during Christmas time. Best moment of 2021

Anyone from 2024? ❤
Cant believe they dropped this 1 month before the movie came out
Just watched wolverine and deadpool. Geeez how times flies man. The excitement and goosebumps i felt watching deadpool and wolverine reminded me of how i felt watching spiderman no way home. Thank you ryan reynolds for bringing some light back to the MCU for the future omgg
Best movie of 2020s
ANYONE IN 2024 ???? <br>👇
"Damn, where was I when this legendary work was announced!!"
I wish i could relive this film for the first time again. Simply the best cinematic experience ever
Between NWH and Deadpool and Wolverine marvels at the top of their game 💥💥
Anyone here 2026?
Deadpool &amp; Wolverine releasing tomorrow
Time really flies
"Such a great experience, the crowd was crazy in the movie theatre."
"BRO I WAS SCROLLING DOWN AND THIS HAPPENED TO GET RECOMMENDED,  MAKING ME THINK THAT IT WAS A NEW SPIDERMAN"
There is tobey and andrew in this movie
"watching this in 2024 and realizing this is what marvel was, this is the marvel we lost"
Who else got recommended by this again ?
I&#39;m curious what kind of movie we would&#39;ve gotten if Sony didn&#39;t work out a new deal with Disney. My guess Venom vs Spider-Man.
After Endgame No Way Home is One of the greatest marvel movie
Almost 3 years later and I still remember the hype for this film it was like nothing I’d ever seen and to be someone who experienced it the 2nd night it was out was amazing I’ll never forget that 2 hours and 30 minutes with my father
Went to go see it on my birthday (2 years ago) and me and my girl had the whole theater to ourselves the movie definitely didn’t disappoint and lived up to my expectations 🔥💯
Now I get it hype on 60´s for Star Wars...
The casting director confused Flash Thompson as Gru. Hence the choice of actor.
Wish this would come to Disney + like the other Spider-Man&#39;s. I wanna see this movie.
"Might be corny but, this movie really helped me heal. I was deployed to the Middle East in 2021 for 7 months and I was depressed as hell cause my then gf cheated on me before and while I was gone. I remember only looking forward to the marvel, dc and star wars shows and movies , waiting for them to come out. <br><br>This movie being the biggest thing ever at the time for me. I remember loving every bit of it! It was all I ever wanted and expected and more! <br><br>From Matt Murdock to Eddie Brock showing up, MJ being saved by Andrew, Doc Ock coming back it was just, oh man I can’t even explain how happy I was"
Still watching this trailer in 2024 because this is one of my favorite
MJ: <b>*falls*</b><br>Tom: <b>Jumps</b><br>Andrew: <b>Jumps</b><br>Tobey: &quot;I missed the part where that&#39;s my problem&quot;
We are in the layers
"Only one peter parker is here haa,, marvel @ sony making us fool 😅😅"
Hey guys wait wait I just realise in trollhunters the rise of Titans Toby dies and Jim reverse the time the same happens in Spider-Man no way home Doctor Strange reverse the time😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
i thought his black and gold suit was the symbiote 😭
"The Hype For Spider Man No Way Home Was Insane, No Movie Will Compare To This One."
Is it me or did when i watch the trailer you all think the black suit was the symbiote suit
"who is watching this on 2024, 7th of july"
IT&#39;S GRATIFYING AS A YOUNG WOMAN TO SEE TALENTED YOUNG WOMEN WITH ORDINARY BEAUTY PARTICIPATING IN MORE AND MORE FILMS.
Still remember when this movie really make alot people hyped
Haven&#39;t seen this yet just bits and pieces..it seems very good..but most marvel comic movies are..
horseshit
This is the truly &quot;u had to be there&quot;
Can somebody explain me if all the people who knew Peter Parker is spider man got alive in other multiverse and they saved those persons why Gwen didn’t spawn there she also knew that peter is spider man
The rumours of this movie thwt Tobey and Andrew are gonna be in this we’re insane <br>I wish I could go back
Nicholas Hammond as the original Spiderman should have been in this.
In the movie he says shit😂😂😂
I was so afraid that i would get a spoiler. I didn&#39;t even watch this trailer. This is the first time i am watching it.
Who has come here after 2 years of this movie 🎥 release.<br> 👇
I still can&#39;t Forget how hype I was when this movie was realised.
"I think No Way Home would have been so much better if Spider-man had faced Kraven The Hunter. I always felt that Kraven was the most lethal opponent of Spider-man&#39;s, he was the evil version of Wolverine, minus the mysterious past. Don&#39;t get me wrong, No Way Home was still good with Toby and Andrew and all of the villians they fought in their movies, but it seemed like Tom Holland&#39;s Spider-man was fighting hand me downs from his two older brothers instead of a different villian. Yes it was fun to watch all three Spider-men together, but too much like older brothers watching over and helping out their younger brother."
Who’s here July 2024
The end of Spider-Man ???
When another Spider Man movie comes out I want the final battle to be all 3 actors of Spider Man Vs Venom &amp; Carnage
Whole trailer one side and Green Goblin line on another
This movie was so big 2 years ago EVERYONE was hyped future generations will never understand that
Those who are watching in 2024...🎉❤
2024 time is going so fast ⚡
This was the movie that finally sold me on Tom Holland as Spider-man. I didn&#39;t like his other solo films... Hopefully his new trilogy is great
I was so fucking hype 2 years ago man<br>Time flies
"Andrew deserves justice , he need Amazing spider 3 ASAP"
before the movie was released in the theater i watched this official trailer and i really thought tom holland peter parker is gonna 1v5 all the enemies and thought andrew garfield and tobey maguire doesnt appear
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=121"">2:01</a> “the perfect transition doesn’t exist”"
I can’t believe it’s been 2 and a half year since this movie released feels like yesterday
This was 2 years ago
Will Doctor Strange appear in the movie??? 😱
The last best MCU movie
Who&#39;s here in 2024?
Spider Man Monday has been the highlight of the summer box office.
At least give us 10 min footage each of Toby&#39;s Spiderman Universe and Andrew&#39;s Spiderman Universe as to what happened in the aftermath of No way home in their universe <br>How they are living and give Andrew his MJ
"Very BAD,the worst spiderman movie ever made.shame on the expense..."
Spider-Man No Way Home is my all-time favorite spiderman live-action flim with my 2 best stars Tom Holland and Zendaya My Number 1 Favorite and Best Flim of the Year 2021.
They copied this multiverse idea from into the spider verse
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=127"">2:07</a> Before the movie came out, I used to think Spider-Man was falling into the multiverse and Doctor Strange tried to &quot;save&quot; him."
The suspense
cant wait for this 😍
"Yes, it&#39;s fan service, but after more than 20 years, we&#39;ve earned it.   And this movie delivered everything we wanted, and so much more.  Spider-Man done so right!  Now, on to the next trilogy--wherein Peter goes to College and begins to rebuild his life!"
Ah yes.. youth.. never satisfied
I dont have everything I want.. I am actually satisfied with my needs...
the line
I had to tell you
Anyone here in 2024
omg he waited so long for this one
"Watching in 2024 , just Same vibs  🔥"
Best movie in the MCU 😍
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=155"">2:35</a> <br>Ever since I saw this trailer for the first time every cell in my body just screamed this was 20 years in the making with that piece of music thinking about the first time I saw Tobey’s Spider-Man back in  theaters in 2002 to witnessing where we came to now"
The last good live-action Marvel movie.
Silly fool spiderman
This was truly amazing.
Epic conclusion of the homecoming trilogy 12.17.21 in 3D IMAX &amp; dolby cinema
Take me back to this hype 🥺🥺
Genz isnt gonna understand how powerful hype this movie brought...the team...the enemies....and all three spider mans
"I literally cried watching this movie at 2 instances, first when Tobey entered via portal &amp; second when Andrew&#39;s Peter got his redemption after saving MJ. ❤"
Team prefer to watching training to watching full movie
Scoobi do says alot flashing back great animations🎉🎉
The hype for this movie was genuinely so crazy
THANK YOU SPIDER-MAN. YOU SAVED DEADPOOL FROM MEETING DEADPOOL IRL. Thank you so much ant-man we love marvel bejesus. Much love Doodle Deadpool. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>P.S. (Wolverine dies again)<br>Spoiler Alert. Whoops.
three years from a post credit scene and now everyone forgot this movie
The real crossover wasn’t in the movie. Wong vs The Beyonder from the 90s animated Spider-Man. On Fox Kids and Jet-X for the young fuckers.
YouTube recommended me this trailer today .<br>What a hopeful movie it was...!! ❤
I’m gonna make my kids Hardcore Spider-Man Fans n will make em wait for years to watch it in the same sequence they were released in. ❤
I MISS THIS MOVIE SO MUCH❤
"Watched the movie, still here 😂😂"
one of my best movies 🙏
Crazy this trailer really spoiled almost everything
I want this time back
Brilliant marketing. We never knew the other Spidermen were gonna be in this movie! Up until the DAY IT CAME OUT!<br><br>Very impressively done.
i just watch ts sometimes to feel something
"This was literally avengers:endgame, PURE CINEMA😝😩"
Nostalgia bait movie and y&#39;all ate it
last movie i enjoyed watching in theater and time really files by
"The movie gave me what I always wanted as a kid, all the Spider-Men coming together in the end."
this trailer still give me goosebumps 2024
My kids won’t understand the hype that was around this trailer
Who is see this in 2024  😅
the new generation won&#39;t ever get how excited you were to see all three spidermans in 1 movie for nearly 3 hours i wish i could see it for the first time again now i just live a miserabel life and probably will for the rest of my life enjoy highschool because life is gonna go heck lower than that after you graduate my biggest wish was to be happy again i haven&#39;t laughed and smiled like that since i left with my buddies for nearly 2 years ago you would think you&#39;d be happy once you left but after you would wish every single day that you could go back and laugh and run around with ur buddies 1 last time peace out i hope you get better the person reading this there will be light at the bottom of the tunnel maybe not for me
Still gives me chills everytime I watch it even after 2 years
We also of course need madame&#39;s web
Still one of the best nights I had in cinema
Waiting for 4
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=138"">2:18</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=141"">2:21</a> They literally chopped out andrew and tobey from their scenes in the trailer to not give spoilers 😂😂"
Gosh I wish I can go back in time and experience this again in THEATERS 😭
"Kids nowadays can never understand how much hype this had. Like everyday we were getting theories... Damn, I kinda miss those days"
I don&#39;t remember this trailer. Maybe it was when I decided I didn&#39;t want to risk any more spoilers that I stopped watching trailers and stories?
With great superpower great responsibility come<br><br>-Aunt may and uncle ben
The last good marvel movie
Anyone in 2024 just reminiscing about better times??
sony really makes the worst trailers
Spiderman 1: homecoming<br>Spiderman 2: far from home<br>Spiderman 3: no way home<br>Spiderman 20: home alone<br>Spiderman 50: heaven is my home
Movie was fire. This trailer was epic
It&#39;s happens 3 years ago 😢
Only Marvel fans knows that this movie hype is greater than endgame..
7 April 2024 saw thi❤
Came back for the comments
Who remembers that the Portuguese version of the Trailer lasted one second more and we could see the Lizard getting an invisible kick?
There will never be another spiderman movie as great as this one.
Avoided to use internet for 2 days to see the movie without a spoiler suck a hype ! ❤
A trailer with zero spoiler
I wonder why Harry Osborn from the Raimiverse isn&#39;t in here...he died knowing Parker was Spider-Man
"I wish we were getting Spider-Man 4 this year, but we’re not gonna get any Spider-Man movies this year anyway which sucks💀💀💀😭"
Imagine if Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man make an appearance it would make it such a great movie
"you are not peter,the future generations cant understand"
Can’t believe it’s been 2 years 😢
The last good mcu movie…
i cant want for avengers secret wars...
Am i the only one who came back here...just to realise... how much hype it really gave us!!!
This was literally the LAST good thing Marvel did.
"Don&#39;t expect much, but it&#39;s worth watching. Although it is nice to gather the actors together, there is still not the desired excitement. There are many missing parts. Still watchable....If you watch Marvel in Chronological form, you will understand it better. Let me show you in a list.....<br>Captain America: The First Avenger<br>Captain Marvel <br>Iron Man<br>The Incredible Hulk<br>Iron Man 2<br>Thor<br>avengers<br>Thor: The Dark World<br>Iron Man 3<br>Captain America: The Winter Soldier<br>Guardians of the Galaxy<br>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2<br>Avengers: Age of Ultron<br>Ant-Man<br>Captain America: Civil War<br>Black Panther<br>Spider-Man: Homecoming<br>Black Widow<br>Doctor Strange<br>Thor: Ragnarok<br>Ant-Man and the Wasp<br>Avengers: Infinity War<br>Avengers: Endgame<br>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings<br>Spider-Man: Far From Home<br>Eternals<br>Spider-Man: No Way Home<br>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness<br>Thor: Love and Thunder<br>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever<br>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania<br>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3<br>The Marvels...."
Still can’t believe this movie even happened all 3 best spider man’s together 😂😂😂😂😭
"no way, it&#39;s home"
The hype of this film was insane
"I never getting bored wathing this trailer, the soundtracks so satisfying, love this part <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=90"">1:30</a>"
Ah man! I got some serious nostalgia while watching this trailer again🎉
Man this is one of the greatest trailers
It was best movie after endgame
From all this time I watched this trailer I learned every part of what they said
"Ya’ll remember when Andrews kick against the Lizard was leaked in the Brazilian version, and everyone was going crazy over the fact that we were getting all of Spider-men🥹🤧"
Did anybody notice the glitch on the part that after may died and both Peter&#39;s going to his school roof top to support him the moment after they jumped and landed you can see the fake placement
"It&#39;s 2024, I still miss this kind of Marvel hype era bruh"
Bro i am watching this trailer after movie and there was no clue for all three spiderman in the movie
Watching this on netflix right now and i came to say this movie is utter nonsense it mentions brainwashing thats funny becuase its exactly what this movie was made to do.... Brainwash everyone its nonsense.
The final good marvel movie
"I remember going to see it the night it came out. I went to school the next day and threatened my class with spoilers…suffice to say, they didn’t act up!"
I havent seen this yet
"Hi, I&#39;m spanish speaker. Somebody can tell me because Strange say &quot;So Scooby-doo this crap&quot;? Which is the context of the sentences? I know that Scooby-doo is a cartoon 😅😅😅"
"In retrospect no way home has a lot of flaws,, but it’s undeniable just how fun, heartfelt, and hype experiencing this movie was"
Watching this on 2024🔥
"Why do I feel this spiderman is sort of annoying creature, stubborn sort of childish unmature unwise talkative? Or may be I just adore Doctor Strange too way much."
Insane to see what so many franchises became in 2 years...nobody is interested in MCU anymore.
I was sobbing when Mj fell I kept looking her up to see if she was booked after this cause I HAD NO CLUE GWEN WAS GONNA 😢
Lmao so many edited scenes in this trailer☠️☠️☠️....the producers really tried ayy
I have never seen a movie that made me feel so many emotions
The joy and emotion I felt throughout this movie and where I was is special to me. Everything felt right within a moment. I appreciate this art.
Is 2 years
Wow it&#39;s been 3 years huh ?
WTF ITS BEEN 2 YEARS ALREADY WHAT I JUST REMEMBER SEEING THE MOVIE AND THING
ayoo tobey and andrew werent in the trailerr!!
The.  I.  I want that movie called Disney+ the Spider-Man movie no way home please
Gotta admire how they made Strange say &quot;They all die fighting Spiderman.&quot; Only for it to be Sandman who says that
Who is here in 2024. And feel nostalgia.
This was the last great Marvel movie.
The hype this movie had📈📈📈📈…i remember my friends and i went in for the very first show in the morning in the very day of release
2 years wow 😮
Already over 2 years ago… damn
I just watched this and i got so emotional because of the hype 😭<br>I&#39;m glad it happened 😁
shout out to the editing guy from Sony Brazil who fucked up the CGI and shows Lizard getting kicked mid air by something invisible 😅😅😭
"I remember watching this movie for the first time in the theaters. I was alone but I wasn’t lonely. Found myself highfiving and cheering with everyone around my seat. It was just tears and happiness, man!"
It was alright.
THIS MOVIE IS TWO YEARS OLD
Obsessed I grew up with all spiderman
Some people didn’t Experience this on day 1 release with the cinema being hyped to see tobey and Andrew
Fun fact — <br>You are not here first time.
"I watched this movie 10 times, But now I want to watch New Home instead of watching No Way Home for so long"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=115"">1:55</a> &quot;You&#39;ll never take this away from me&quot; ⚡😤💪🏼"
The fact that this is turning 3 years old this year is honestly crazy
SPOILER ALERT!!!⚠️.<br><br><br><br>Why did they kill Aunt May in this movie. And why didn&#39;t peter call MJ to push the button on the cube before it was too late 😢
Awesome film
"@ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=72"">1:12</a> it makes me laugh so much how bad the cuts are 😭😭😭every time"
so what happens when this peter meets his universe&#39;s otto octavious?
everyone remembers where they were...
How has it been 2 years already?!!! 😳
Can&#39;t believe this was 2 years ago....still remember it like it was yesterday....
It&#39;s by far the best trailer that I have watched to date. And I keep coming back to watch it.
"Rewatching this trailer gives me a special feeling. Remembering how excited I was for this movie and the hype that surrounded it. Man, I haven&#39;t felt that in a while."
One of the greatest Spider-Man movies the fans has ever received 🕷️
miss the moment
3 years old and a Classic.
The last great MCU film. We will never get another like this.
"I didn’t want to go watch it alone, so after three weeks and several damn spoilers, I decided to watch it on my phone(didn’t looks great, but still watchable)…once the movie ended I cried and I honestly can’t tell you if they were tears of joy or tears of finally watching it, I remember begging my dad to take me to see maguire Spider-Man when I was in elementary…I was a good boy for sometime until it released…it’s just just so good, dare I say that I personally loved this more than infinity war and endgame"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=154"">2:34</a> music 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
This trailer came out on 11/16 back in 2021. The movie dropped in December and this was the only like legit footage we had for it. God dam the marketing for this was weird.
"I just saw this movie, and for fvcks sake.<br>This version of spider is the most r3tarded, and care free &quot;superhero&quot; I&#39;ve seen.<br>I grew up with Tobey Maguire and the differences between both are out of this world.<br><br>Not only did he jeopardize the lives of everyone because he didn&#39;t make it to college, but then he went around Dr. Strange&#39;s advise because &quot; he felt he could help them&quot; avoid death with no regards for the consequences of doing so.<br><br>Can we get a real Spider-Man?"
i’ll never forget seeing this in theatres ugh
2018: Avengers infinity war <br>2019: Avengers endgame<br>2021: spider man no way home<br>These movies was time to be alive for superhero fans missing those days now 😭😭😭🥲🥲
"If you want more hype, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” makes its network television premiere on January 16th at 7 PM on FX!"
After watching this movie<br>I&#39;m thinking that Andrew&#39;s Spiderman will start dating Zendaya😍😚 and tom will become venom man.👿😂
this is best film of spiderman series
i recommend a crazy movie for everyone to watch
I definitely recommend it to a good movie.
I definitely recommend it to a good movie
trailer still gives me chillss
"I can&#39;t believe this movie is almost a year old already. Damn, time flies!"
That is a best Marvel movies cant wait
Can&#39;t wait to watch this amazing movie again again and again 😍🤩🤩🤩
I really like it. Great movie!
I can&#39;t wait to watch the movie 🎉 Does anyone want to share spoilers?
The future generations aren’t gonna understand how hype this movie was
"Fun and adventure, a wonderful movie that deserves to be the first"
Tom is really suit for new generation SpiderMan 🎉
Coming here almost eight monts after the trailer dropped stil get chills watching it. I wish we could relive the hype
I love this movie so much
Süper heyecan verici
"Watching the trailer again makes me nostalgic, it was one of the best experiences in my life that I will never forget, without a doubt the best movie"
The last great mcu movie.
I would give anything to experience the unreal hype for this movie again. Can&#39;t believe this came out two years ago.
"Watching the trailer after watching the movie made me feel pain since doctor strange said crap instead of shit, maybe because of youtube"
"&quot;Yeah so just have Jamie Foxx, as Electro, say nothing of value. Tell him to be upset that Peter Parker isn&#39;t black&quot;"
Who&#39;s here on new years day?<br>👇
Better than Endgame🔥
Whos here on 1st January 2024?
Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 2 years...
2 years later still the greatest movie ever.
I would love for MARVEL to create a movie based on the original spider-woman/ Jessica Drew and she meet Peter Parker! I love all of the spider-man movies and can&#39;t to see what Peter Parker gets up to next. Thank you for your time to read this xxx ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m buggin or sum I thought this movie came out in 2022
"That December,my godd..i have watched this no. Of timess but still ❤❤end of movie,will bring you cry"
"😂 Marvel Studios ? But surely No Hollywoodcamera !!! Nasty unsharp Backgrounds , 👎🎥, IS IT forcing eyesickness ??? This ain&#39;t No Quality ! I do ASK a question: the movies camerauser ,If He IS with His car ON His Gasstation , will He agree that only His half carwindow gets cleaned or will He Desire that the carwindows have to get completely cleaned because He wants to have a clear sight ? But for the moviewatshers He switsh the cameraeffect unsharp active ? Sabotage? Nasty service Bad Quality ! Movie destroyed !"
No Way Home &amp; Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3 are the last good Marvel movies.
Time flies
The ending of the trailer had is all HYPE!!
I would do anything to go back and watch this movie with my friends
I miss this era
It&#39;s weird that he says &quot;ever since I got bit by that spider&quot; which we never saw in the MCU.
Most overrated movie ever.
The hootings in the halls begins
"Love the move. absolutely fantastic.<br>Destroying Stan Lee&#39;s concept of superheroes, implementing future black spider man as a subconscious pretext, life goes on, people are changing, more indoctrination, no more mass manipulation, love it. <br>Subliminal messages love it. I need to be part of this movement 😊"
Here after the movie completed its 2 years anniversary. Time flies...
TWO YEARS AGO IS INSANE
Happy 2 years!
2 years ago today 😢 time flys
Happy 2 year
"damn its been 2 YEARS since this came out, it feels like it was yesterday i watched this for the first time"
It’s been 2 years……
Tom is not good for actor<br>Tobey is very nice then tom
"I come back after 2 years and it was so awesome i remember back in 2021 when the trailer just came out I was so hype, thank you so much"
2 years later... 🎉
On this day 2 years ago we witnessed a masterpiece
Here we complete 2 yrs of this incredible movie...and lemme know who is there who doesnt get chills seeing its trailer after all this time!!!

2 years ago.
I wish i had a time machine 🫠
"2 years ago, my Christmas break started, I failed my math exams, and I immediately went to go watch this with my best friend. Best day of my life."
I miss that feeling
This Movie Will Be 2 Years Old Tomorrow <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Time Files Man....
2 years to this incredible movie. <br>I still remember I was so excited going to the theatre to watch the movie on 16th Dec 2021 in India. <br>This movie also helped me meet my best friend for the first time after 1½ years of lockdown. Oh the hype was real man. I remember waking up on 17th November 2021 at 6 or 7 am to watch the 2nd trailer and it got around 3M views in 2 minutes... <br>The hype was so real. I wanna relive 17 Nov 2021 and 16 Dec 2021 so bad. 😭❤️‍🔥
"It&#39;s been 2 years... ❤, even today also i can feel the hype which it had at that time."
The multiverse Is real
"God, I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 2 years, I used to read the leaks every day and get excited, now no movie excites me and I miss 2021 so much."
This movie is so good
today marks the day when this movie became 2 years old 😔
wow didnt even realize this movie existed
I miss the hype
Amazing.Just.Wow.It’s been two years……
Where the time go...
It&#39;s been 2 years
"It&#39;s been 2 years since the trailer was released, and I remember trying not to fall asleep at night so as not to miss it and woke up at about 6 a.m. and watched it."
This era in my life will never be topped
Trailer STILL gives me chills
"You know, I watched this movie on the Thursday night screening before the “release day” and I never watched this trailer until today, two years after I saw the movie. Damn it was hype, but I’m glad I didn’t watch it, this trailer spoils too much😭"
"The popularity veiws were in the brazillions,its a fact and a pun"
"I come to remember, I will never forget this movie, it was beautiful to live that Spider Verse experience in December. ❤"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) <br>Director: Jon Watts <br>Filming Dates: October 14, 2020 - March 26, 2021 <br>Release Date: December 17, 2021 <br>MPAA Rating: PG-13 [Parents Strongly Cautioned] <br>Runtime: 2 hr 28 min (148 min)"
the hype for this movie was actually insane
they cut the parts with all three spider-man out
Can&#39;t believe this movie is real it&#39;s literally too good to be true
"Nobody believed this dude would try to take on 3 former spider super villains himself, I for sure knew it was the perfect strat for them to all come together as spidermen in this movie."
2 years passed without a spidey film
Andrew Garfield was across the street at the Paris Theater in NYC promoting Tic Tic Boom when this trailer dropped.
2 years is wild
You don’t need to have powers to be a superhero <br>you just need to be a good person
it&#39;s being 2 years and i still enjoyed it😅❤
Next movie must be &#39;Spider-Man Homeless&#39;😂😂😂😂
"The ability of the Spider-Man films to portray Peter Parker&#39;s dual life—that of an apparently normal teenager juggling the extraordinary responsibilities of being a superhero—is one of their most notable features. The struggle to strike a balance between one&#39;s personal life and one&#39;s responsibilities as a crime-fighting vigilante, whether played by Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, or Tom Holland, is a recurring theme in the films. Because it captures the universal struggle of juggling conflicting facets of one&#39;s life, this theme appeals to audiences.Filmmakers can now vividly depict Spider-Man&#39;s web-slinging stunts and fights against strong adversaries thanks to advancements in visual effects. Movies featuring superhero action sequences that go beyond swinging through New York City skyscrapers and taking on legendary villains like Venom, Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, and the Vulture have set a higher standard.Furthermore, what sets Spider-Man movies apart is how moral quandaries and the human side of superheroes are portrayed. Audiences are deeply impacted by Peter Parker&#39;s internal struggles, his desire to do good, and the sacrifices he makes for the greater good. In conclusion, by fusing exciting action, gripping narrative, and likable characters, Spider-Man films have irrevocably altered the film industry. These movies, which feature everyone&#39;s favorite amiable neighborhood superhero, never fail to enthrall audiences, whether they&#39;re swinging across cityscapes or navigating life&#39;s challenges."
I don&#39;t really like every new Spider-Man that comes Now you really compare Toby&#39;s and Andrew&#39;s Spider-Man with this generation&#39;s Spider-Man
This was the greatest experience
"Best movie ever! This is the greatest MCU film of all time in my opinion besides Black Panther, Endgame, and Guardians of the Galaxy."
NOTHING will top the hype of this movie not even Avengers
I literally woke up in the midle of the night to watch the trailer 😂
"I’m here, exactly 2 years after this trailer released ( 18th December 2023) and I’m still having goosebumps watching this and writing this comment! This was the best ever thing! 😭😭😭 that hype was real!! Something else"
"In hindsight, its CRAZY how much they spoil in this trailer..."
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩💖
2 years ago we got this amazing movie🥹🫶🏾
Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s 2 years now
2 years....
"Damn, 2 years now?"
I can’t believe it’s been over 2 years since this master piece of trailer dropped. I am grateful 🥹 for being able to experience this
2 years after this trailer... Feels like yesterday
I have no idea why but after 2 years i am back here 😂
Exactly Two years since this trailer released
I remember waiting for this trailer the whole day and i woke up so early to watch this trailer<br>damn..
I&#39;m so excited for this movie 😍 I think tobey maguire is ganna be in no way home 👀
Still feels surreal
Man I’d love to time slip to my theatre of December 17
2 years...
As of today it&#39;s been officially 2 years since this amazing trailer has been shown. I say this is the 2nd best marvel trailer of all time after Avengers: Infinity Wars. Oh how I wish I can go back to 2021 and relive the hype again.
Here I am at 2 year at that trailer
2 years
"Wow 2 years ago,time flies man.I remember being so hyped for this movie"
2 years already
"two years, wow"
2yrs for this 💥💥🤌🤌🤌
Two years ago today was when I felt the ultimate hype for this movie
TWO YEARSSSS
This trailer released 2 years ago today. Man the hype feom the trailer was awesome.
Two years later and I still get fucking chills
Happy 2 year anniversary
Happy 2 years!!!!!
Wow this was two years ago. Crazy how fast time is
2 years of this trailer! Gosh it felt like yesterday we were so hyped about it LMAO. Time really flies :)
I understand why people disliked Tom Hollands Spidey Trilogy I’m also one of those people who had trouble with it cause in the MCU Peter was like a puppy under Tony’s feet all the time but his character development in this film finally got rid of it and even if Tobey or Andrew weren’t in the film it still would’ve been good and gave him the character development he needed.
I miss the hype it was GENERATIONAL
2 years passed of this trailer... wow...
Love the movie so good
Bro idk how I knew this trailer came out 2 years ago. Woke up and I was like wasn’t the no way trailer dropped today in 2021. Crazyyy….. 😂😂😂😂
One year later and this stills giving me chills
I Am Missing The Incredible Hype Of This Movie 👑👑
i want this movie once again in theaters
Bro I cannot wait for this to come out next month
Man I just re-watched this and found it even more awesome then in theaters it was so epic man Nothing compared to the hype
This Movie Just Makes Me Appreciate The Sam Raimi Trilogy Even More And More!
Mary Jane is wrong  and what is that stupid Chinese or hawiian boy is ..why act and look so stupid ...and not spiderman more like spiderboy
Aunt May&#39;s death and Tom Holland weeps: 😪😴<br>A tough moment as Tom Holland bids farewell to his girlfriend and best friend: 😪😴<br>The returns of the villains: 😱😱<br>The Spiderman returns of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield: 🥺🥺😭😭
Lool black MJ is disgusting
"This movie is a masterpiece, I love it so much. Nothing will ever compare to the No way home movie theatre experience, I’ll never forget it. I love all the spider man movies so much. This movie is so special to me since I grew up with the Raimi spider man’s and I have seen all the movies and I love them all. Spider man will always be my favourite super hero"
Will never get over hearing Goblins voice and just chills!!!!
this trailer still give me goosebumps even after a year of the movie out
Will go down as one of the most iconic movies of all time
This movie is something else! Insane.
The beginning is boooring
What soundtrack is?
S&#39;il vous plaît faites The Amazing Spider-Man 3 🥺🙏
people really watch this shit? this looks terrible
I remember watching this with my friends at the cinema… what a day to remember
Over one year so fast. Spider man Should return.
"I remember the hype for this SOOO much, I remember watching this trailer over and over"
The editing in hiding Tobey and Andrew was SPECTACULAR
I miss the hype for this movie so much 😭
Man the no way home era was an elite time seriously never before have I ever seen so much hype for a movie. Also living in the UK we never cheer in our cinemas not even for endgame but for this we all went crazy
"I just wish I could experience it for the first time again. I&#39;m gonna watch this trailer, when I grow old and remember how hyped we all were for this movie."
I really hope they make another one❤️
Will always cry for not being able to experience this movie again for the 1st time😭😭
What an experience i had with this movie!!!
It’s crazy how i completely missed hearing about this movie.  I wonder why they didn’t do a better job at marketing it and hyping it up
It all went downhill from here
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=90"">1:30</a> this trailer goes from being fine to being epic"
God i hated and loved this movie 😭
"Seeing this in theatres was an experience. This trailer was hype, but the film itself surpassed it by leaps and bounds."
I just watched this movie and was completely unprepared of three spidermans and bad guys from the past. Didn&#39;t watched a trailer and nobody told me about. 😅just blew my mind. I couldn&#39;t believe it.. All three in one movie 😅amazing.. Just amazing. 🙏🏽👍🏼😊👏🏼well done.
This is the second best mcu movie behind Avengers: Endgame
This was the shit man I miss the hype
"It&#39;s nearly 2024, can&#39;t understand how the time flies... I wish that hype from these times to come back again and to watch the movie for the first time."
This movie&#39;s hype will always be next to Endgame
This was the most depressing spiderman movie ever.  I wish it had never been made.
I just wanna live my total life in the hype of this movie ❤
"Is it me or did anyone see other spideys in this trailer???, 🤔🤔"
I didn&#39;t watch the movie the reason was Toby maguire has been the main character from the first 3 movies and my opinion he would still make a great spider man
Trash movie made for kids.
There&#39;s never gonna be another infinty war craze <br><br>And then they drop this heat.
I mean it’s 2023 nearly 2024 and let’s be honest this has to be one of the best trailers ever made
After 2 years anyone watching this trialer? This trailer still getting goosebumps 🤯🤩
No way home was a 9/10 movie  i think tobey and andrew could had moree scenes
this movie cemented my dislike to the Peter Parker that Tom Holland portraits and the MJ in the same universe.<br>I personally prefer the portrayals of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire.
I wanna experience this in theatres AGAAAAAIIIINNNN
"DREAMing of these comic books, my favorite Comic Book store is Secret Headquarters it makes me yelp"
A year later and I just realized that the Far from home trailer got more views than this one
Thank you for this movie. Thank you for the message. It helped me be more aware of enemies as well as heroes and you GOD. Thank you that you’re always speaking. Nothing was made that was not made by you. ❤❤❤
Andrew Garfield entry and future generations kids be like: why this people yelling at him
Will always remember this feeling
This movie came out almost 2 years ago wth
In my early 20 I watch Tobey M as spiderman i the cinema and know 20 years later.....this.<br>Can&#39;t belive I just learn about this movie now 😮😮😮.  <br>Its amazing.
"To think we all went insane in 2016, when the silver war trailer came out and we saw Spider-Man at the end. Who would’ve thought a couple years later we would see all three of them  together."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=94"">1:34</a> spider-man in a scandinavian forest looks so illegal to see"
"My spiderman movie. Everything was perfect, characters, story, action scenes, villians and realize date. Made my 2021 ending memorable."
He said he got bit by a spider then how come he makes his own web fluid this is so confusing me.
almost 2 years. this hits harder in 2023
After almost 2 years i still got massive chills from this trailer
This movie made 2021
This one gets way more than 5 stars!!
Too bad Venom is just a cameo on this movie 😢
This movie was so hype
"If I could go back and relive this experience again, I would. One of the most pinnacle moments of my life. Glad I lived to see it.<br><br><br><br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=130"">2:10</a> I&#39;m also now just realising that you can hear the sound of Andrew Garfield&#39;s web shooter going off... how did we all miss that? 💀"
"Youre not Peter Parker , that masterpiece moment"
almost 2 years is crazy🙏😭
"One of the three best MCU movies in Phase 4 and 5 in my opinion<br>Vol 3, No way home and Wakanda forever"
"I remember watching this movie with my girlfriend and now she&#39;s already with someone else. I really miss her and the tickets of this movie, I still have it and kept it."
Only we guys know how much  hype this movie created
One of the most overrated comic book films of the year.
"Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man in every Universe . Let’s go, I loved the movie"
2021 Was an incredible Year for movies. Hype was insane back then.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=141"">2:21</a> the fact that they didn&#39;t show Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield is amazing"
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Marvel Entertainment Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment
"This is the worst episode ever. This is crap. I had big hopes about this part of Spiderman, but this is crap. Flat boring story, etc.."
Dont get me started on Doctor Strange and the little nerd back on earth 1999999
OK.
Great.
Great
I can&#39;t it&#39;ll be almost 2 years 😫
Time really files.
"Watching this for the first time was amazing, i loved the ending and every moment of it, 10/10 masterpiece right here!"
Tom Holland is the best Spider-man
This was the worst Spider-Man movie ever made.
"Most of Spider-Man’s enemies are not evil like Sandman he was just doing that for his daughter and if his daughter was ok then Sandman won’t be evil, electro was just sad that no one cared about his birthday and when he turned into electro everyone started to shoot him, Green Goblin 2002 was forced to take the Goblin Serum so the company don’t fall but certainly the serum was not finished 100% and it has some side effects"
The best movie and hype i ever experienced. Truely this made me so happy.<br><br>I so want to relive that hype. Again. <br><br>Pls god make a better movie than this and make us relive the hype.
"This is not a movie, this is an emotion for us🙂"
U know.whats funny we can all be spider man just move up In a nice neighborhood in New York and let aunt may send u yo college 😅😂
"Most overrated and sh*ttest movie I&#39;ve ever seen. This is just a stupid fan service, I don&#39;t understand why people call it &quot;A Masterpiece&quot; 😅😂"
My prediction 2 years ago was 65 percent right
"Peter, you’re struggling to have everything you want.  While the world tries to make you choose."
wanna watch it again in the theater plsss.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=151"">2:31</a> I knew deep down they were bringing Andrew back for this scene when I first saw it and it made me extremely happy"
Best movie till now 🎉🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When I watched this I cried seeing Tobey maguire my childhood spider man was back we need spider man 4 cos Tobey has still got it
Where&#39;s toby and garfield💀💀💀💀
"Bro really started from being a ballet dancer, to spiderman and then taking backshots. Bro isn&#39;t shooting webs, he&#39;s getting webs shot into him."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=91"">1:31</a><br><br>“You’re flying out into the darkness to fight ghosts”<br><br>Line never gets old"
Dude I remember being so hyped for this move that when I saw the green goblin on screen for the first time I jump in my seat and maybe almost shouted
"I remember what I was doing when this released, I was chilling, Watching Call Me Kevin play Until Dawn, When I saw that this trailer came out, And that was my best November 16th ever"
"Sony, my point is that the Andrew Garfield trilogy should end.  After the movies morbius and kraven the hunter, the amazing spider-man 3 should also be made. we should see shailene woodley as mary jane watson and the sinister six that will probably be created through oscorp and andrew garfield&#39;s black suit"
"They weren&#39;t fooling anyone, tom landing on his own in a wide shot, the villains coming into toms universe with no hero, sandman and lizard diving for no one 😂😂"
Spider-man is now more popular than Batman.
Can’t believe almost two years since this movie was coming out. I remember how insane the hype was. Good times🥲
nice movie with handsomessss
I can&#39;t wait to see Spider-Man 50: Old Folks Home.
Great movie Tom holland is a really good actor
i want to go back in time to watch this movie for the first time again and know all the characters there (i wasnt a marvel fan before nwh)
Aamir is Norman Osborne<br>Shah Rukh is Tony Stark.
"It&#39;s been a year.. but still, i blame aunt may for everything.. just stay dead may... godddd"
You’re telling me that this one trailer got 80 MILLION views!! Dam spider man must be marvels fav
"I went to a pre-release of the movie at 12 PM and I can’t explain how close I was to losing my voice due to all the screaming. Jesus, the hype for this movie was so damn worth it."

Across the spider verse is out and this movie is still so amazing🔥
"Because of Brazil, we knew Tobey and Andrew were in this film"
I would watch this trailer every day when it first came out
Still The Greatest Marvel Superhero Movie Of All Time
I feel bad for those people that didn’t experience this movie like the rest of us
"The HYPE around this movie was INSANE…, I will never forget how excited people were to watch this movie"
Bro the hype for this was crazy!<br>“Is Tobey and Andrew Garfield gonna be in no way home?”<br>Good times😂
Great movie
"&quot;Peter, your struggling, to have everything you want, while the world tries to make you choose&quot;"
Crazy how I just seen this movie today and I even missed the pre hype to it smh never even seen the trailer until now but definitely top 5
But where is Venom?
Green Goblin: Peter your struggling to have everything you want while the world tries to make you choose.
"&quot;Maybe she didn&#39;t die for nothing,  peter &quot; ❤️‍🩹"
"Here after watching the movie😂. This my favorite Spiderman movie cause the superhero has to deal with the real consequences of his actions. I know if Peter had just let Dr strange send the villains home there would be no plot. However the consequences of peter choosing otherwise made me so happy, don&#39;t try to change fate."
Trailer purposely doesn’t show Andrew and tobey
"wow, 1 year and 8 months since the movie came out already"
When dr strange said ‘please Scooby doo this crap’ in the movie he actually says ‘please Scooby doo this sh*t’ which is quite funny 😂
Guys if you look lose at this movie when they were fighting thanos nearly returned
Why am I here again?
One of the most overrated super hero movies of all time.
This is an unforgettable experience
"Literally, this trailer broke the internet"
"WTH, I gotta watch this again!!!!"
"Best spiderman movie. This movie will age very well, too bad the future watchers of this wont understand the hype very well even if they knew it was a callback from all the previous spiderman movies because those old spiderman movies never became their childhood nostalgia movies."
I wanna go back to opening night when I saw it just to relive how the theater screamed when Garfield jumped through that portal
Once in lifetime experience to watch this movie in theatre&#39;s that I missed I&#39;m never gonna forgive myself for that.
"Overrated movie in my opinion, This movie isn’t going to age very well."
"Wait did guys not notice something, in the scene where Tom/Peter charges at electro, lizard, and sandman, electro and sandman seem to not go after Pete but at something or someone else, 2 other people that are helping Tom/Peter fight them, Tobey and Andrew."
Canon event
I’m still hype when I see the trailer😂
"I still shed tears of emotion, watching this trailer"
"Spider-Boy...ir Spider-Teen is more apopro. And how could they have a middle-aged vllian fighting a teen, tryna kill him?"
"When this trailer first dropped, I remember how hyped everyone got when the &quot;Hello Peter&quot; happened, the theater i was in went nuts"
"Don&#39;t, it&#39;s a canon event"
"come to think of it , mcu peter tried to interfere with a canonical event first before miles"
They insult Spider man too much by making three different person
"The movie was the best, ngl. Thank god a Spider-Man 4 is coming."
"i re watched today and Strange said &quot;scooby doo this shit&quot; it felt so weird i had to check it, i knew he said crap somewhere."
Idc what anyone ever says this movie was the biggest event in spiderman history
In my opinion a better movie than across the spiderverse
Can’t believe it’s almost 2 years ago just felt like yesterday I remember getting hyped for this movie
That was his canon event!
This movie. Amazing. An experience. Just… just utterly 🥲 EVERYTHING
Would love to see Tom and elisabeth s characters together
This is the most Legendary movie
"I’m just wondering why a trex roar from Jurassic park is the sound of a car being smashed at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=47"">0:47</a>"
"Future generations will never understand the hype we build up waiting for this movie to be released 😭😭,this is by far the greatest movie marvel made"
I wish I could watch this movie for the first time in theaters again
This movie was so hype!!! Everyone hoped for Tobey and Andrew and watching this in the movie theater was so much fun!
This movie was so hype!!! Everyone hoped for Tobey and Andrew and watching this in the movie theater was so much fun!
I think I was more pumped up for this movie then I was 4 endgame or Infinity War
1 year but why this part is not on netflix?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=135"">2:15</a> what Dr.Strange and that little nerd did back on Earth 19999."
They are so many Tom Holland spider man movies that end with home now I think there will be a &quot;spider man homeless&quot;movie lol
bro was trying to stop a canon event
I just can&#39;t wait for the next one🎉🎉
Watchin it even after 2 years gives me goosebumps🙃
"Anybody here after Spider-Man Across The Spider Verse? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=161"">2:41</a>"
So let’s do the pros and cons. GF and best friend don’t get into college of their choice. So instead of that? Aunt May dies and the his GF and BF and the world forgets who he is. Bringing back all the old cast members was great idea. But the storyline of casting a spell (while he continues to talk to Dr. Strange) because friends didn’t get into college of their choice and they still would have got into after saved Deans life. That storyline is the worse of ALL the Marvel movies and even some of the DC. 😉.  I thought “Far Away from Home” a lot better Jake Gyllenhaal was great villain even if lil far fetched and few holes.
Garbage film. Into the spiderverse and across the spiderverse is better
Aphelia Ophelia
This cool
No one in the future will understand the hype around this movie
"One of the worst movies ever, even the cgi is terribile. I&#39;m glad I refuse to see this garbage at the cinema"
This movie sucks
"&quot;And don&#39;t even get me started on Doctor Strange and that little nerd from Earth 199999&quot; (Miguel O Hara, Across the Spiderverse)"
Happy birthday Tom Holland🎉
Omg all the theories were so fun we thought the craziest shit would happen and it did
For those who don&#39;t know:- This movie was the outcome of 20 years of spider man  franchise.
"When I first seen this trailer, I thought “there’s no way Tom Holland’s Spider-Man is gonna take them all on” then I was like 🤯"
Poor thinking this for entertainment whole time they putting it right in front of y’all face that they gone open a portal with the pandora box
"Turned off half way through, sooooo boring…<br>Box tick <br>Box tick"
Let’s be honest this is the best spider man movie all the spider man actors teaming up and all the villains wish venom was in it but gold movie
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=155"">2:35</a> real goosebump"
It&#39;s amazing how the entire fight on the statue of liberty had 3 spidermans fighting yet the trailer seamlessly made it look like only Tom Holland spiderman was there. The team making movie trailers are so underappreciated.
Literally the best movie i ever seen 😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This movie and trailers are fantastic
"If you were to tell me 6 years ago we&#39;d get a finale to a whole saga with Tom Holland fighting villains from different franchises to save the whole multiverse and sacrificing his identity in the process, id never believe you."
Nostalgic looking back to this (the reveal) the united spidey fans..ahh what a great Spider-Man movie to date ngl
This is how you do a trailer. Sublime
"Noted. Now, how about beginning."
The hype when this trailer dropped was immaculate
2 years later it’s already nostalgic
This masterpiece had me SOBBING too many times
"mid movie, trailer was good though"
"It would be cool if a new Spiderman appears in Spider-Man, the Cosmic Spiderman that is already listed in Marvel fandom. This could be well combined with the multiverse of Doctor Strange as an example. In space lurk certainly still many dangers and probably new opponents of Spiderman."
Im So Happy I Got To Experience This Movie With All The Hype. Our New Generation Will Never Understand.
I was so lucky it was my first movie which i watched in theatre on my birthday at 15 dec when i watched the movie i cant explain what it was for me the crowd went absolutely mad on tobey and adrews entry i always watched both of them as my childhood spiderman i just love this movie❤
In the real movie they say &quot;Please... Scooby-Doo this sh*t&quot; not crap
"Marvel logic is weird.   Fact,  if you love someone, but forget them, you will still feel love.  Emotions are a totally separate thing, and they don&#39;t forget.   A prior film made a comment that changing the past doesn&#39;t change the future.  They are so wrong with  all of  it.  The movies are fun, but stupid"
Re -release superhero movies in india
👉 in telugu cinemas they are re -releasing so many old movies in india 🇮🇳 please re -release hollywood superhero movies in india. Re -release in 3d format 🙏🏻❤️❤️
They should’ve switch electro for vulture IMO
Hindi and Punjabi dubbing of this movie will be dubbing by Shubman Gill.<br><br>￼
"I am leaving this comment here so after a month or a year when someone likes it, i get reminded of this masterpiece ❤"
Imagine Tobey plays the roll of old Spider-Man having the kids with MJ the kids are spider kids
This is the tag team we&#39;ve been yearning for. This movie was legit fire 🔥💯
"still one of the best marvel movie<br>phase 4 is garbage but black widow, shang shi and no way home are 3 exceptions<br>edit i saw guardians of the galaxy vol 3 and that&#39;s a 4th exception"
I can not describe the hype I was feeling while watching this trailer in November 2021.
I was so excited when this movie came out In theaters
This movie was amazing. It was what my husband and I went to see on our first date
Anyone else come back and just watch the trailer to TRY and get the same “special” feeling when we first saw it? 🔥🔥🔥
This trailer was fucking insane
The hype and build up for this movie was insane and broke the internet
After watch only 34 mins . I understood why no one I talked to ever want to be spider man cause he is pathetic woke and marvel has taken that pathetic zingoissm to next level . Worst spider man ever . It was just 34 mins of headache
This is one of the fanticst movie ever
"Truly a once in a lifetime experience, the hype when Tom posted the first teaser on his Instagram account and the day the movie finally came out..."
"Marvel Entertainment, Sony Pictures Entertainment, they announce so much everywhere to hype for this big action genre"
"I&#39;m gonna make everyone jealous with just this one sentence: I have actually for some reason missed this movie totally and haven&#39;t still seen it, i will be watching it for the FIRST time now, in 2023! :D"
To see how far MCU has fallen. To let computers be their actors. To let AI be their writers.
Crazy knowing that this movie will be 2years old this year!
Omg i wanna see this so bad ❤
The best movie I have seen in my entire life
"Finale&#39;, 20 years, 8 Film&#39;s and ( May 3, 2002 - April 12, 2022 ), Tomorrow is my Anniversary with 1 year to Wednesday, April 12, 2023."
Next movie of Spiderman<br>&#39;Spider man don&#39;t have  bathroom&#39; 😂
Favourite movie of all time❤
"Watching this trailer I accepted that if I didn&#39;t see Toby or Andrew I&#39;d still enjoy the movie.<br>Watching those portals open and seeing them, man I had tears, goosebumps like I was a kid again 😢"
“Peter………..you’re struggling……To have everything you want…While the world tries to make you choose.”
"Honestly the only movie since endgame I actually fucking loved, doubt ill get as much excitement until GOTG 3 and maybe secret invasion if I&#39;m lucky"
bro its insane to think that across the spider verse and beyond the spider verse are probably gonna reach the heights of this movie I mean god damn I love spiderman
It&#39;s been a year but still this trailer gives goosebumps 🥺🔥
"after seeing the trailer for across the spider-verse, it seems Miles is going through a similar situation that revolves around changing fate"
"I came back after the second trailer of Across the Spider-Verse, and Miguel O&#39;Hara said the reference caught me off-guard LMAO. 😂😂😂"
Earth :199999
Can&#39;t wait
It was so good
Me too I&#39;m so excited for the movie I get to watch it before it comes out.
The only good thing we got from Phase 4
I’ll never forget the hype for this Movie and the reactions on opening day already knowing Tobey and Andrew were in it. But actually seeing them return in theaters for the first time after all these years is just one if the best moment in History
"A fantastic Spider-man film! I absolutely loved the concept of bringing in past Spider-Men, and the way they incorporated their stories into the MCU is genius. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I cannot wait to watch more films with both this spiderman, and the multiverse.<br><br><br>10/10"
"They fked up in this movie, i thought they went back to the way things were at the end so how come may still died i thought theyd bring her back."
Cant wait for spiderman 4
This is the Most hyped Marvel movie 🎥🍿  Ever
the hype for this was amazing
"I will never forget the hype for this movie. Trying to figure out if the other 2 Spider-Men are really in this movie, the urgency to get tickets before they run out, then finally watching this movie and seeing the other 2 Spider-Men show up and not just for the final battle. I can still hear the audience reaction in my head when Tobey and Andrew finally showed up. I wish I could go back to 16th December, 2021 opening night and rewatch this movie for the first time. ❤"
One year already I think now would be a great time for the dark bully venom spider man because he lost everything
"Looking back at this trailer after a year, I just remembered the Brazilian trailer where Lizard gets kicked by seemingly nothing (obviously it&#39;s Andrew&#39;s Spidey) lmao<br><br>I still remember that those few frames basically 100% confirmed (albeit blatantly obvious already) the rumors of the other spider-men appearing lmao"
I played fortnite<br>chapter 3 season 1 Spiderman mythics
Love tobby. as Spider-Man
Still remember I was going to school when this trailer dropped and I watched it in the bus. Damn time flies really fast
The best movie in phase 4
If CN characters portrayed Spider Man NWH:<br><br>Finn the Human - Spider Man<br><br>Farm World Finn -The Amazing Spider Man (Andrew Garfield)<br><br>Pen the Human (pilot) - Friendly Neighborhood Spider Man (Tobey Maguire) <br><br>Rick Sanchez - Doctor Strange <br><br>Sunder (Ben 10) - Green Goblin<br><br>Hudson Abadeer - Doc Ock<br><br>Ice King - Electro<br><br>New Death (Together Again) - Lizard<br><br>Elena Validus - Sandman <br><br>Chelsea (Clarence) - Michelle Jones<br><br>Clarence - Ned Leeds
This movie is so boring. Bleh. Avoid.
The memories bro 😢
Stupid boy ruined all
I&#39;ve still got the depression we need time back on the screen!!!!
I think this is just an average Spiderman movie. Far from home was better imho
Bro!!!!! There&#39;s not one or two Spiderman&#39;s!! Bro there&#39;s 3 Spiderman&#39;s!!! OMG!!! THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME!!! AND I WAS BORN IN 95..... I GOT SO CONFUSED WITH THE SPIDER MAN SERIES WHEN I STARTED SEEING ALL THESE NEW CHARACTERS BUT LET ME TELLL YOU THIS MOVIE PUT THE CHERRY ON TOP OF ALL THAT&#39;!!! This is a must watched movie if u are a spiderman fan!!! This movie literally proves that there some many possibilities in life
"Watching a year later, and still get chills"
The only good phase 4 movie
"I still want to watch this movie, even though I already watched."
multiple decades to build this once in a lifetime HYPE!!!
"Even after 1 year, Green Goblin&#39;s voice is enough to give me chills"
I love how in their own universes the spider man villains would be super human and considered godly but when they enter the MCU they’re just normal in the grand scheme of things
"Damn the hype for this movie was insane. Despite being a big marvel fan I never saw infinity war or endgame at the cinema and only watched the first trailer in order to avoid spoilers as I wanted to watch in my own time but when the hype began to build for nwh I got really invested and went with my dad to see it. The first half disappointed me as it wasn&#39;t what I hoped and I found the humour very intrusive in what is quite a dark film but from the electro and sand man fight onwards I became really invested and loved it. Not in my top ten MCU films but definitely the best MCU spider man film, probably 5th best spider man film overall and easily top 15 MCU films. Great film and great experience"

the most successful movie with spiderman in the world
Hard to believe it’s already been a year. The hype for this movie was truly something else.
Best Marvel trailer of all time?
The masterpiece
"I just wanna say, this trailer ruined my life. I was angry. I told myself if they don’t show the other spider men in this trailer, they aren’t in the movie. They weren’t. I was done with it. Then 2 hours later we got the lizard getting punched by air all over the internet 😅 GREATEST MOVIE EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD"
I am Bat- Oh wait wrong video
History
I would do anything to watch this again for the first time
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=162"">2:42</a> Your asshole after one sip of coffee"
"“Peter,<br>Your struggling,<br>To have anything you want<br>While the world tries to make you choose.”"
"Coming back to this banger, this is cinema"
Am I the only one who nearly lost it when Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man returned?
The stupidest movie ive ever watched. Should be called &quot;the amazing stupido-man&quot;
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=111"">1:51</a> the most perfect part no doubts."
"I&#39;m sure 10millions of views are mine, I literally watch this trailer every single day, I love this trailer and I remember the hype in 2021."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=136"">2:16</a> all the villains"
the actual most hype for a movie since the last prequels for starwars 😂🤣
The hype didn&#39;t match the movie.  Very disappointed
can we all agree that this movie is the greatest fan service of all time
The goblin is Parker’s most personal adversary <br><br>Gwen dies <br>Aunt may dies <br>And in the comics tv show or something he’s responsible for Mj’s disappearance<br>I also forgot how he traumatized <br>Tobey’s aunt may while she was praying 🙏🏽
My favourite scene is when Steven says scobby do this crap
Our children will not comprehend the impact of this movie…THIS WAS CINEMA
Wait it&#39;s 2023 already?
"year later, still doesn’t feel real"
"Just everything about the movie and the trailer is so good, like it’s good action, good art, design"
"To this day 2023 Feb 17 , <br>This was the last hyped Marvel Trailer and The Last Movie that actually delivered the hype it had and what the audience wanted"
Who’s this new kid?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=88"">1:28</a> The most epic part. Still gives me goosebumps."
"This movie had sooooo much potential, till they only had three spider men for only 30 mins"
Who&#39;s here before Ant man and the wasp:Quantumania?<br>👇
"Yup , it&#39;s oficial , every single Holland Spiderman sucked , loved the 3 Maguire ones , loved even more the 2 Garfield thus why pissed me off not making 3 , but the 3 with Holland no thankyou. Please may the next 3 be more like the Garfield ones."
This Movie was a Complete Joke...maybe 12yo and UNDER would watch it...but otherwise it&#39;s a complete Joke...Toby Maguire was the ONLY believable Spider man anyway...this guy was hopeless
PLEASE MAKE MORE OF THESE THEY ARE MY FAV VIDS TO WATCH
“I can’t save everyone” hits home everytime 😢
It was a stupid movie
"I just watched this for the first time 2 days ago... Honestly got fed up of the superhero stuff... But that&#39;s all tv has on it these days.. so got sucked in..<br><br>It was excellent.. thought I&#39;d come read comments and realized that some (many) don&#39;t feel the same... <br><br>So decided to comment.. to put things in perspective.<br><br>See i saw the first spidermen in cinema... There was hype... All we had before this eas batman and superman movies... Xmen also just took off... These were cartoons that we grew up with that shaped us in more ways than we knew.. so it was important to us to see these characters come to life on the big screen...<br><br><br>Tobey was our first spiderman... We didn&#39;t have internet like we do now with data and cellphones.. so for us.. he just vanished... And was replaced by Andrew... And then 2 movies later... Another spiderman... <br><br>Each director told us a story... In their own way... And because they each remembered things differently... There were differences... <br><br>And we were asked to forget the previous movies... Because it was like a slate being wiped clean and irrelevant to the current happenings... <br><br>This was a breaking of the fourth wall for us...  By having them break the third...<br><br>The only other time this happened?? X-Men first class (mystique). <br><br>... So yes... There was a great deal of hype... Because then unlike now.. we didn&#39;t expect that it would have been the last time for us to see either of them as spiderman again... <br><br><br>Stated another way... Imagine 70 years from now... A reboot of James Cameron&#39;s titanic.... But the old lady telling the story is kate Winslet <br><br>Or 19 years from now... An ironman reboot... With Robert Downey Jr. <br><br>Or perhaps my best example yet.... A strange world where heath ledger and Joachin Phoenix square off against keaton and  kilmer.<br><br>Or all the bond actors together in one film...<br><br>See.... It&#39;s impossible... .... ... With this film Hollywood did the impossible<br><br><br>Oh! And fyi... It&#39;s the X-Men and spiderman that made enough money and got the MCU happening... Because it was profitable and people wanted more... <br><br>Compared to hulk, green lantern, and a lot of other shitty superhero movies along the way<br><br>(Yes lantern is DC.. but my point is the real world isn&#39;t isolated like that... They&#39;re all one big genre)<br><br>.... Goblin... Oc... Those characters died on us... And we felt it... So to see them.. in the ORIGINAL format....  We fans were done justice...a proper homage. They brought 3 generations of spiderman fans together in a way I don&#39;t see happening anytime soon until X-Men finds it&#39;s way"
This came out in 17th of December 2021 God damn I feel like it came out a month ago and it&#39;s 2023 now
I love this film A LOT... But my logical sense is always tingling<br><br>How can you resurrected 2 death characters from other world and drag them into your world?
Overated
This wasn&#39;t just a movie.... it was an experience!
I know the all parts of experience spider man.
Can anyone just the linked movies of it
"Peter Parker killed Aunt May, summoned a whole gang of evil villains, and almost imploded the universe... just to get his friends into M.I.T. Such a stupid movie and Spider-Man is such a stupid superhero for stupid people."
"Now is one year ago, I literally love it 😀 😍 ❤"
"I hate this movie, this movie is so bad that they’ve ruined MCU"
SCOOBI DOO THIS CR@p
I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS. but  i couldn&#39;t. i thought it was stupid. I&#39;m sick of Spiderman being a child
Spoilers: <b>The Great Reset</b>
Alternate title for this film: how to do Spider-Man one more day right”
"When I went to the theaters to see this movie in Dothan AL, the audience cheered when Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire appeared. That was the first time I&#39;ve been in a theater where the audience cheered. And I can say it was awesome."
utter fkn drivel. bottom of the barrel
Spiderman no way home 2021
How of you regret missing this gem in Theatres like me?<br>Like👇
How I wish I could go back in time and witness this hype again
Just realised a week to him was like 5 years for us
Spiderman - Homecoming<br>Spiderman - far from home<br>spiderman - no way home<br>Next <br>Spiderman - Homeless
"They were so smart for not putting the other two in the scene at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=142"">2:22</a>, They pretty much confirmed they were in the movie without actually showing them"
"for me, It been 20 years since be spider-man fan by far this movie get me so much hype for everything as called for like past spider-men actors to came back on big screen, and amazing film."
The SpiderMan outfit looks like it was bought from the dollar store fs ! 🤣🤣🤣
Well Can I get Multiversal Movie of this Level?<br>I know DC is not badass Studio like marvel. I should not expect anything for me.
This movie was so fucking awesome
None of these compare to the first 3 movies. They literally demasculinized spiderman after those as each one goes on. Having a women in a suit guiding him... can&#39;t talk to girls he likes... always timid and agreeable..getting beat up and smacked around... but yet he&#39;s &quot;spiderman&quot;? How much more could they demasculinize him and make him appear so wimpy. Ridiculous how these new woke movies are today.
Trash I can’t lie very disappointing give it 3/10
The trailers for the film are always better than the actual film
one of the worst movie ever
The magic was that everybody forgets that Parker is Spiderman. So why Parkers friends forgot complet him ????? Is a movie error??
"I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=72"">1:12</a>. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=394"">6:34</a> that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don&#39;t think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it&#39;s great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I&#39;m struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=3462"">57:42</a>.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=72"">1:12</a>. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=394"">6:34</a> that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair.  It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. Tt absolutely moved my soul , and i don&#39;t think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it&#39;s great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a piece of bacon do such a thing? I&#39;m struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=130"">2:10</a>. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious.

This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you."
I can&#39;t believe how this movie was succeeded! I watched NWH and Green Goblin being the real villain of this movie is on an Kang level! But some scenes had made me cry even Aunt May&#39;s death. Sometimes I also think if Kang comes out surprisingly and shocked us it would so cool to see Peter vs Kang....
why is this nostalgic
"such an annoying movie, superhero? more like super idiot.... shoulda listened to strange"
One of the best fucking trailers of all time lmao
the hype was out of this world
"I was wondering, If Gwen Stacy died near the end of The Amazing Spiderman 2. How did Peter know that she died? Because didn&#39;t they teleport when Electro was fighting spiderman??"
im from the future and i can confirmed you that there will be 3 spiderman on this movie
They were laughing 🥲 like he said &quot;Dr. Tutto Tottapius&quot;
This was the second most hyped MCU movie. Infinity War is 1
"Only people who grew up on spider man series will understand the hype. this is insane!! And there’s more to come ,GREAT JOB MARVEL!!"
My sister cried at the movie theater because of this movie 😭<br>Edit:btw happy New Years 🎉
"You know I saw all the fan made videos of Tom holland, Toby maguire, and Andrew Garfield and I said it was to good to be true but here we sre"
"Don&#39;t watch this movie, before watching spiderman 1,2,3 and amazing spiderman 1 and 2."
I’m so happy that No way Home Teaser Trailer released one day before my Birthday (It’s on the 24th of August)
"Coming back to revisit the anticipation and see the alternate footage, interesting stuff (and GREAT movie). 🕷🕸🕷"
"With the Home Trilogy, Into the Spider Verse, and the PlayStation games from Insomniachaving kicked so much @$$, there has never been a better time to be a Spidey-Fan!😎🤟"
One of the best marketing and trailers I ever seen. Movie was good and the hype was palpable
I remember just screaming at all those shots of the villain literally waited ever minutes of the day for the trailer can&#39;t believe it&#39;s now been a year crazy 🙂
Not forget to subscribe
1 year later this trailer still gives me goosebumps
What’s crazy is that this video got 4 million views in 4 minutes
That Was The Best Christmas Ever ❤
The Hello Peter was something else ❤
"This movie in itself was a love letter to the super hero genre , the fans old and new . It was truly an event of a life time"
the hype was unreal.i wish i could watch this movie for the first time again
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=119"">1:59</a> Tobey Maguire Spider-Man"
This movie is already nostalgia after a year ago
"i will probably never have the guts to watch this because i will cry, and i don&#39;t want to. But i will always love spiderman. see look i am crying rn."
I watch this full movie
So excited
"Does anyone else think the final battle would have been even more epic if it had been only 1 Spider-Man vs. 4 villains? I mean, the final battle is epic, but it could be even more so if it was like in the comics, a peter against several villains at once."
I love the way YouTube can’t say shit so it says crap.<br>Movie: scooby doo this shit<br>YouTube: scooby doo this crap
Its been one year since this dream movie has been released
Watched this trailer for the first time after I watched the movie and dang they put so much in there the only thing they didn&#39;t spoil was Andrew and Tobey and people still figured that out
at first I thought this was an actual joke
"and that&#39;s it, we&#39;re out of ideas"
november 2021/december 2021 was peak fr
It&#39;s been a full year since this masterpiece released man.
"Here for one year anniversary, unreal. We&#39;re all lucky to experience this in theatres."
"A year ago today, this amazing movie came out. Still wish I can go back and watch it for the first time again for the intensity and the reaction from the crowd"
Cant believe this movie came out a year ago
"It&#39;s been a year,"
<b>Hello Peter</b> it&#39;s been a year
arealdy a year WOW
Can&#39;t believe it has already been a full year since we were given this masterpiece. I was very fortunate to have witness this in theaters during opening weekend and it was indeed an experience I will never forget. Hoping that we get another Marvel movie like this in the future.
1 Year ago we witnessed the Most greatest Spiderman Movie ever
"The movie is already 1 year old!!!<br>It definitely shows a sad face of our reality; anyone whom is accused of something or under suspicion people are ready to turn on them and get violent <br>Peter is facing a true struggle; is it true everywhere Spider-Man goes chaos and calamity ensues? Whatever damage is left behind we have to pick up the pieces <br>Can you actually fix someone, we should give people second chances to start over rather than meet our fate, a simple solution isn’t the only solution, can we do more than expect disappointment therefore avoiding disappointment?, morality isn’t a weakness, revenge never makes anything better <br>After 20 years I can safely say this was absolutely worth that wait! <br>Intense action, the stakes are the highest they&#39;ve ever been for Spider-Man, and there&#39;s a ton of heavy emotional beats I wasn&#39;t ready for <br>Terrific to see past actors come back from previous franchises and lots of nods to the culture of the character; even Green Goblin gets more exploration trying to suppress his dual personality but with little success plus Electro gets a good course correction since his birth and Doc Ock is offered a way out without being power hungry with his hubris, more sympathy for these individuals rather than being straight up bad guys <br>More stuff centering about rehabilitation as opposed to just jailing up people <br>I wish more of the villains were explored further  but the film delivers enough for longtime fans plus it&#39;s the best acted from Tom Holland as this current version <br>He really does bring the central core of the character full circle with sorrow, guilt, regret, and being responsible <br>Love how Ned gets to be more proactive next to MJ too <br>The climax is astounding visually and emotionally <br>I am curious how future movies will benefit from this now that Marvel and Sony are finally collaborating  <br>The movie is about looking backwards but learning to go forwards and there will always be consequences trying to change things or set things right not to mention showing the test of what it means to be a hero let alone what it costs, sacrifice and sparing others pain <br>Director Jon Watts closes this cycle of Spider-Man movies with quite a jolt not forgetting the human drama, exciting fights, and embracing the colorful fun of the comics <br>Best movie of 2021 and one of the best Spider-Man movies period!"
I can&#39;t believe one year have past 🥺
DANG ITS BEEN OFFICIALLY A YEAR AGO! Wow Future Generation are gonna be like “What’s no way home?”
"<b>it&#39;s officially a year ago since this movie released,</b> December 17 2021, it&#39;s now 2022 Dec 17, it&#39;s crazy how it&#39;s been a year ago, the hype was real, but not as crazy as end game, I remember eating and watching nwh, man why is time moving so fast. I&#39;m freaking out :(, it feels like yesterday when I was waiting for the release and watching theories, and avoiding leaks"

“With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility” - Uncle Ben &amp; Aunt May
"I see this trailer and it gives me the same feelings since the first time I saw it, it&#39;s beautiful"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=88"">1:28</a> from this point onward the Music, The chills of Alfred Molina saying that Peter’s flying into the darkness and William Defoe saying Peter’s name, the Hype, the leaks of soundtrack #19, the Custom trailers and intros made by YouTube to satisfy our hunger for more. The theories on Reddit that we all read. The updates on Twitter that made everyone gasp on the edge of their seats. The memes on Discord that just gave everyone a good laugh. It was as if the entire world was working together to break down everything Marvel threw at us. It’s all coming back to me 😌"
"Everone saying they saw a glimce of electro and sandman<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=136"">2:16</a> be like:"
Damn how has it been a year since this came out

This movie was a masterpiece. Top tier. Probably best in phase 4 (next to Shang-Chi.)
I want to Live the experience again

"After all the leaks, all the hype, all the everything… this was a solid 8/10"
Just watched it. It&#39;s like watching a whole different spiderman movie. Wat ever happened to the straight hardcore superhero movies. The new Marvel headshots have just about turned ALL these superhero movies into a comedy show.
This movie is a easy 100009090900009889685734068525250/10 my favorite movie of the god damn all time.
This was without a doubt the best Spider-Man movie and best movie of phase 4.

Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been a year already 💀
"Wow, a year ago this great trailer, without a doubt one of the best spiderman movies, thanks Marvel and Sony for so many emotions!"
Can’t believe it’s been <b>ONE YEAR</b> since this trailer. I still remember the hype..
HAPPY 1 YEAR!!!! Of TRAILER 2!
One year ago.
Who’s here for 1 year
One year later and wow
"This trailer came out a year ago, you know that?<br><br><br><br>Let that sink in for a moment. This absolute <i>masterpiece</i> of a trailer for this absolute <i>masterpiece</i> of a movie came out <i>exactly</i> one year ago, <i>today!!!</i> And I <i>still</i> get chills whenever I watch it. This movie was a once in a lifetime experience that I don&#39;t think will be recreated by Marvel or any other film studio for that matter, no matter how hard they might try to do so. There will never be another cinematic experience quite like Spider-Man: No Way Home. Even after all this time, it still feels like a dream to see all <i>three</i> Spider-Men in the same movie together and all get their time to shine. Everything for this movie was just pure <i>perfection!</i> I think Homelander said it best:&quot;It was perfect. <i>Perfect.</i> Everything. Down to the last minute details&quot;."
"I thought venom would be in this movie, and i thought goblin would actually turn into a goblin monster😂"
Happy 1 year
Happy 1 year later thanks you for everything again and happy anniversary
THE WHOLE TEAM IS GRATEFUL TO DR STRANGE TO BE W/ PETER 😭
Nothing in life will ever compare to the hype of this movie. Millions of people all having some of their childhood hero’s returning together in an epic MCU movie. <br><br>The build up with the leaks and constant rumours of if this person is actually in the movie.<br><br>And then when it finally happened. All the theatres losing their mind when the three Spider-Man came on screen
It has been one year since the release of this godly trailer
Tomorrow this trailer becomes a year old
Best movie in The wold
Stupid movie with ultra stupid main character
No way this was a year ago..
I miss the hype..😢…. Anyone else?… 😔
Again here 🥺❤️
This is the best trailer I have ever watched in my life
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=141"">2:21</a> the &quot;invisible&quot; spider-man cospiracy was real"
"If I had one wish, I would wish to relive watching this amazing experience."
I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been a year now 🥺💔✨...
Who else is watching this at the end of 2022 and has watched the full film a thousand times. Ps fun fact if u watch the scene were peter is swinging through the city with mj to escape the angry crowd at the start of the movie carefully enough you’ll see a fortnite billboard on a building
Omg andrew could never-
No way it’s been ab a year
No one can beat marvel Studios 🥱✋
"man that was such a beautiful, emotional, heartwarming movie. i just finished watching it &amp; its one of the most perfect movies ive seen that i s just 10/10. the writers &amp; director did an amazing job. all 3 spider man actors gave a great emotional performance 👌 bravo 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏"
"Here 11 months later, this trailer makes me realize that this movie would of been so hype even without tobey and andrew"
Andrew Garfield is the worst spiderman.
Miss the hype for this movie 😭😭
Man i miss the hype for this it was insane
I feel blessed that I went to watch this in cinema❤️
"Fav era of all time, the No Way Home era :(("
"I can&#39;t believe this movie is almost a year old already. Damn, time flies!"
What is the background music name?
Forever grateful I was able to witness this movie
Ya but this trailer are nice that are true
Marvel never fails their fans with the bests plot twists and I will forever be thankful that Andrew’s Spiderman finally got to save his Gwen Stacy🥲
I love Tobey Maguire Andrew Garfield an Tom Holland 3 Spidermans
im watching this movie rn and still get goosebumps with the trailer lol
"See you all back here in like, 5 years when this is nostalgic ✌️"
I was literally holding back my tears watching this film…Truly an amazing experience.
THIS MOVIE IS ALMOST A YEAR NOW TIME FLIES SO FAST!!
nostalgia hitting my head
"Peak cinema and a peak time to be alive in general, I don’t think I’ll ever be happier"
this all feels so nostalgic now
Nearly One Year Gone .This trailer is still a 🔥🔥🔥
"Still to this day, this trailer gives me chills"
Dont this generation ever get tired of the same thing how many more spiderman movies are they going to make before they come up with something new
A year ago whoa
"William Defoe was amazing in this film.<br>Like most others I love to see Andrew come back showing he is a great Spider-Man if there was better writing involved. Also I thank the writers for making Jamie Foxx the Electro we deserved.<br><br>It was cool to see Sandman and Lizard but they mostly were overshadowed by Goblin, Oct, and Electro."
I remember when I was waiting for this trailer and watched it about 100 times when it dropped. I was at work 😶
I wanna go back in time!
look the moive has been realsed but the end of the moive you turned on Marvel Spider-Man right after spider jumps of his window in  Christmas right?
How has it already been almost a year man 😢 I will never forget this legendary trailer and movie
I feel like watching  reality show rather than a movies.. Is not a good cinematic experience and the dialog is awful
"when it was announced this trailer might be coming a certain day, my manager, who is a marvel fan, was like “if it comes out while we’re working, we’re stopping production to watch it.”"
I just wish we could go back in time to see the hype
damn it&#39;s almost a year
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=123"">2:03</a> Tap to Get the Goosebumps"
Who else is watching this in October of 2022? It’s just soo amazing! It’s just a <b>muah</b> really good trailer

Is Venom in this trailer?
"Before part 2 came out, I was saying they&#39;re gonna do Sinister 6, With Vulture, Scorpion, Shocker 2, Tinkerer with Tink supplying 2 more Villain&#39;s. That would&#39;ve been amazing. Instead it&#39;s this Random Multiverse thing. But oh well still good, but not as good."
I have watched spiderman no way home
This Movie was The best Christmas gift of last year.
"Spider-Man No Way Home was incredible, watching it for the first time was an unforgettable experience man, seeing my childhood favorites return was amazing, one of my all time favorite superhero movies and the perfect way to wrap up the MCU Spider-Man trilogy 👏👏👏 Excited for the future 🕷"
MARVEL PLS MORE TOBEY ANDREW TOM SPIDERMAN AND VENOM
I’ve watched this movie 6 times and the trailer like about a billion yet it never absolutely never gets old
"not that the hype has died down looking back the movie is actually really bad, basically the non mcu Spiderman characters carried and tom holland spiderman was basically iron boy jr for like 85% of the movie. It wasn&#39;t until the last 15 minutes he was actually spider-man."
“Spider Man no way home”<br>“Insect man direct path to my house”<br>there the same trust me💀
The only good thing that came out of Phase 4.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=75"">1:15</a> Scooby-Doo this crap!"
"It&#39;s been 3 chapter &amp; like always this new machine spiderman always be the one who fak the thing up. Just pure dumb. That&#39;s what you get, stupid action come with stupid consequences."
When will spidy go to his home<br>In his first movie he was home coming<br>In his second movie he was far from home <br>And now in his third movie he is no way home <br>In fourth movie I think he can&#39;t go to his home
Bro.. I love marvel because of this... They knew what fans wants... ❤
Cant wait for this movie
"You are not Peter Parker, the perfect goosebumps at the right spot ❤️🔥"
Why am I here
Why are Tobey and andrew garfield not in the trailer
Next movies:<br>Spider-Man Home Alone<br>Spider-Man Homeward Bound<br>Spider-Man Daylight Come And He Wanna Go Home
I miss toby meguire being spiderman my childhood superhero the nostalgia is always there unforgettable 🙁😊
Me to Marvel and sony bring back bully maguire ( spider man 3 black suit) once again<br> Ultimate crez of Spider Man fans worldwide
"Spider-crap. Probably One of the worst movies ever created. The worst ir the Century for sure. How can you Invest só much Money n a crap such as this movie. The script is a joke, carácters full with left wing polítical LGBT, and other agendas. The zombie generation Addicted to Smart phones, só annoying, Impossible technology, etc... Tryng to avoid old clichês, they come up with new ones, like a black MJ, a hot ant May. Peter Parker best friend is probably the ugliest man Alive. An Indian flash?!?! OMG and all this on purpose, like if the audience was stupid"
"I used to be a great fan of spider man movies, that is, of the first three, with tobey macguire. Theses last movies are so bad. They want to be cool, and trendy. Both the movie and the characters are so annoying, wanting to be cool everytime, and they want  to break sipder-man tradition, with all these Leftism/LGBT agenda&#39;s cliches, that it ends so FAKE, and iritating. Thes last spider man remind me those adolecent movies of the 80s, filled with cliches. Now they are packed with 2020&#39;s cliches, like the constant usage of smart phones, and people trying to look cool... they want to give the impression that super heros could be something normal in our society, that it ends sounding so fony... In fact, I cannot watch more than 5 minutes of these new super-heros new films, not even to watch the great special CGI effects... so much money spent in these crappy movies."
Zendaya looks like a regular weird teenage girl in spiderman but irl she&#39;s an A-list celebrity
I keep coming back to watch this trailer 😂
"I have to say, I thought Toby Maguire was hands down THE best Spider-Man and Peter Parker, his first two films were untouched by far from home, homecoming, and all of Garfield’s movies<br><br>But this movie made me cry 4 full times, not even tobys movie did this to me but I suppose it’s the history that made all that happened in this movie stronger.<br><br>This movie is finally the direction I wanted them to take Tom Holland in, the serious and dark tone, the consequences, the sacrifices, everything Tom should go through that makes us relate to him even more.<br><br>One of the best movies I’ve seen, I think non fans and fans and skeptical people should watch this, I would place this with Toby’s first two movies as one of all time greats, and it has alota cool fan services that we get to see but also very raw and real moments that make the movie geniune, Garfield was great too and am glad he gets to show off the people that hated on him"
We want hulk no way home<br>What we got:
I don&#39;t kno Hy they&#39;de involve romance in heroes movies . They ruined it
Dude I&#39;m am 12 years old
spider man no way home is so good
i wish i could experience spiderman no way home for the first time again
I think only deadpool 3 has chances to beat this movie.<br>&quot;With Ryan Reynold and Hugh Jackman&quot;
I still felt goosebumps whenever I recall the day i was going to watch NWH
"MOVIE REVIEW <br>       Spider Man: No Way Home is the third movie in the Spider Man trilogy starring Tom Holland. As a warning, going forward this review will contain spoilers. In this story of action, love, and self-sacrifice, Peter Parker, a seemingly ordinary high school senior, faces several trials after his identity as Spider Man is revealed to the public. When his new reputation threatens his chances of being accepted into college, with the help of Dr. Strange, he tries to cast a spell that will cause the world to forget that he is Spider Man. However, Peter messes up the spell and accidentally brings villains from various universes into his own universe. With the help of Dr. Strange, his friends, and heroes from the other universes, Peter makes an honorable sacrifice and saves the world from the villains. <br><br>       I thought that this movie was incredibly enjoyable. The film itself was skillfully developed with an interesting plot, talented actors, and impressive cinematography. One aspect of the plot that I especially appreciated was the balance of action and dialogue within the movie, each which added to the progression of the storyline. The plot also has a relevant and inspiring message about the importance of doing what is right and the nobleness of self-sacrifice. Although none of the characters always make the right choices, the film makes it clear how their good choices bring more positivity into their situations while their rash or unethical decisions negatively impact them. When they make bad decisions, the non-repentant characters, such as the villains, are defeated while the ones who work to correct their mistakes, although they may suffer, are victorious. This conveys the message that even when people make bad decisions, there is merit in persevering and striving for what is good.  For example, when Peter disobeys Dr. Strange, the villains come into the universe and threaten his city. However, when Peter, recognizing that he was wrong, takes responsibility for his disobedience and chooses to work with others in an attempt to stop the villains, it has a positive impact on the world that he is striving to protect. Throughout the film, several characters, such as Peter Parker, Aunt May, and MJ, have to make difficult decisions that involve significant sacrifice. It is a truth-filled film that acknowledges and has an appropriate attitude towards the beauty of the virtuous actions of Peter Parker and his friends and the ugliness of any actions motivated by the evil intentions of the villains. Even though the film has a fictional plot, the moral themes within the movie as well as the virtuous actions of the characters can be influential to today’s society. I also appreciated how the movie respected the dignity of the human person. Although there was death within the movie, particularly the death of Aunt May, the movie acknowledged the tragedy of her death appropriately and honored the sacrifice that she made. One aspect of the movie that I did not appreciate was that there was some unnecessary language. However, overall, I found Spider Man: No Way Home to be an impressive film production."
The emotions this movie gave me😭
No one But me getting shocked at the pumpkin bomb and doc oc like I haven&#39;t watched the movie 100times.
The best movie of phase 4
"I am more than glad…. More than grateful.. That I didn’t watch a single trailer, a single peak… NOTHING… Giving me not even the slightest chance to get a  spoiler. I just came from a marathon  watching every single movie/show needed in chronological order for this movie… Let me tell you that I didn’t believe a movie could literally have me screaming of excitement and tears of PURE JOY IN ALMOST EVERY SCENE!!!"
Another stupid movie ending but it&#39;s also becoming a habit in disney studios and now that theu bought marvel just wait for more of them.
Im so glad i got to live this moment in life❤
"Okay..I loved the movie, watched it when it came out and watching it now. Would’ve loved a tv series…just saying"
I tried to know nothing about this film before I saw it.  Thankfully I didn&#39;t and what a surprise!!!!
Anyone watching this in 2022...🙂 can&#39;t believe that nwh era overed.
Spiderman is the best✨
This far the best spiderman movie of all time
Love this movie
love this movie
“The concept of the multiverse is one we know frighteningly little of”
"I thought I was strong .. But no. <br>I cried when Tobey appeared, when Andrew talked about Gwen and when Andrew rescued MJ.."
I watched I love it❤
venom wasn&#39;t appear in this movie. If it does the movie would be complete
"Watching this trailer one year after the release , still get me goosebumps"
How like the spider man do like in this comment
"Still can’t stop watching this trailer since they brought back the original actors, especially Tobey Maguire. It was the best movie I ever saw."
IM WATCHING THIS TODAY
"Uh. It&#39;s bad enough that they remade Spider-Man like two different times btw lol with two different people but now they&#39;re bringing the original stuff into the new I hate it so much there&#39;s only one Spider-Man (tobey Maguire) and this aint it...   my favorite part is when the real Spider-Man shoots webs out of his arm and the other two are like wow and he says what you guys can&#39;t do that, lol of course you can&#39;t cuz you&#39;re not the real Spider-Man either of em.. Classic."
bro so we juss gonna act like electro saying “you not gonna take this away from me” isnt so badass cuz ts still give me goosebumps even after watching ts so many times
"I remember the day I went to see it first, never in such a long time I had seen so much hype for a film."
This is best moive of SIPDERMAN
Loved it thank you the extended edition was so good!!!! So cool to see lizzard sandman otto harold and max and the peters😍😍😍
I teared when I Tobey showed up in the movie.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=75"">1:15</a> bruh in the full movie strange said :so scooby-doo this shit"
"Going back to this trailer still gives me chills! I remembered when I first saw this, I thought <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=162"">2:42</a> was the scene where multiverse versions of Peter would’ve entered"
Can they make a trailer with all 3 peters now??????
This movie is still in my local theater after 10 months
3 heroes of Spider-Man is coming. And there are 5 Villains is coming too.
Why this movie is in theaters again? I have already watched this movie long time ago!
Who here after seeing spiderman no way home again in theater....
Did we really jump timelines? I could have sworn that this movie just came out this year! Or maybe I&#39;m tripping! idk🤣
I watch the new spider man no way home 🕷💙❤
Why is this movie back in theaters where I live
Cgi is shit clearly visible that those arms are fake and toy
Abt a year ago I was so hyped to see nwh. Now I’m hyped to see the extended version
They forgot Andrew and tobey
Please is it an adult film or for the kids?
"I thought Gwen Stacy, Miles Morales or Mary Jane might pushed through to this universe, but aside from those characters I&#39;m loving the one&#39;s that made through 💕🌟😍🤩 This by far is the best Spiderman movie I have ever seen can&#39;t wait for the next one"
The best movie of phase 4
I like how the trailers didn’t reveal Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield Spider-Man  to keep the suspense
Man the day I went to see it was a day I will never ever forget
Why are Canadian theatres opening this movie again yet it’s old🤔
Why is this back in theaters again?
I am thinking about going to see the extended version in a theatre today for $3
I will never love another spider man  movie as much as the first spider-man  part 1 and part 2.....he was a high school kid  bitten by a damn spider scared to death going through the power change and didn&#39;t know what the hell he was doing .....That was my spider man plus he was cute Tobey maguire 2002 back then LOL.......
I wish Stan Lee lived long enough to see this movie he would be proud
There&#39;s always the other home nobody talks about. Thinks it&#39;s called heaven.. 🤣 come get it!
"&quot;They&#39;re starting to come through, and I can&#39;t stop them.&quot;<br>Really, aren&#39;t you like the magiciest of magic fuckers? And aren&#39;t they like cheesy second rate villains with most of them having dime store costumes and technology? Are the most dangerous ones just super strong? Can&#39;t break through reality with strength, I mean they aren&#39;t the Incredible Hulk."
"I just notice that this movies don&#39;t take serious this times, just like the teen Titans of this generation 😕"
"I watched this again today in theatres, the more fun stuff one and I loved it, I laughed even more. And I cried so much again. Such a good movie. My favourite movie of all time"
"Its just a true masterpeice,what a fantastic job done by movie unit,Hats off you guys 👌👌"
Its a big story and sad ending…
Who&#39;s Waiting for Sep 02 ! Indian Fans! Spider Man No Way home: Extended!
"I&#39;m not american, and I can&#39;t seem to be able to take seriously super hero movies where people dress up. I just can&#39;t. Cheers!"
I paid 17 dollars to see this movie and  it was worth ever penny!! I LOVED IT
I want the Monkees
This was a brilliant way to make a new Spider-Man movie with Tobey in it. Always wanted a Spider-Man 4 but this is even better!
I watch the new Spider-Man No Way Home movie and I have to say it’s one of the greatest Spider-Man films I ever seen more importantly all the villains returned I was having goosebumps when they returned and also the fact is we have all three Spider-Man back together for this film when I saw Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield returned I also had goosebumps as well and I was in excitement so this literally the best Spider-Man film I have ever seen it’s one of my favourite films of all time
"the present peter makes me sick, annoying kid! 👎🏼"
One of the best trailers that Marvel has put out there.
Y is this not on Netflix yet???!!
Damn the amount of Respect you could actually feel for TOBEY from Dr.Oct one liner “Youre not Peter Parker!”
I&#39;m so sad that uncharted is is the end
Watching the trailer again because its more cooler than the actual movie..
"Amazing film! I loved how the 3 spideys came to meet each other!!! BUT PLEEEASE make another film with Andrew! Honestly, to me he was the best Spidey as it came closest to the cartoon version, Idk he is just exactly the way I imagined him to be when I was little :D"
"I watched this movie when I was high on weed, just imagine how good the experience was.. It&#39;s called &quot;Once in a life time experience!&quot; 😭"
Spider-Man no way home full movie Bana
Sean
I have full movie in my channel
I like the movie
I don&#39;t know WTF some people are living without watching any Spiderman movies
Can this movie come to Bangladesh
&quot;Peter... You&#39;re struggling... To have everything you want... While the world tries to make you choose!&quot;<br>This line haunts me everyday! 😨😢
Watching after the movie is farrrrr from out and this still gives me shivers
I love this movie but everyone seems to forget the the main actor wad Tom Holland
Miss those times🥺
This movie was truly a masterpiece and I cannot wait to see what SONY does with Spider-Man in the future.
I want the Monkees
It is very emotional 😭😭
In some ways. This was more hyped up than endgame
"On Sep 2 , Its coming back🔥"
I like how they edited out the part with Lizard getting punched by air
If I had to describe NWH in 3 words it would be<br>“Brilliant but lazy”
Beat Spider-Man movie hands down 🤞🏿💯
"I just realised, all of this was caused because Tony Stark said &quot;barf&quot;"
"lol in the movie we know there&#39;s three peters but without that knowledge I&#39;d be pretty damn confused what the lizard was doing at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=140"">2:20</a> lmao"
"I Love the part when the green goblin initially body slams Spider-Man through the floor and then casually walks away after. He was like, &quot;And stay down little punk!&quot; 😂😂"
This movie is a once in a lifetime experience 😭
I Watch This Because of Toby Maguire
Even today Willem Dafoe&#39;s Green Goblin is as much terrifying as he was back in 2002
Will they come ?
This movie is definition of Nostalgia 💯💯💯
i was not expecting that! this is by far my fav spiderman movie ever! no spoilers but god damn that was amazing 😭❤😅😅
"Dude, I love this movie so much, other than some minor nitpicks and one issue I do have, movie is damn near perfect. And I&#39;m so glad I got to experience this in a theater opening night. This was probably my favorite movie theater experience next to seeing my first solo Batman movie in theaters which was The Batman."
Nooo! He ends up all alone. Poor baby
Didn’t this video had 78M views?<br>How the f did get lower???
"<b>Tom Holland will Be back With Many Movies Like, Venom 3, Marbious 2, Spiderman 4-5-6,, Spiderman FreshMan, Whch Wll Be Prequel, Avengers 2025 Wow</b>"
A fuckery this💯
thanks sony pictures
"i honestly did not think the movie would be good at all,but now i am here crying.i am so thankful that they ended it like ,it did not get shitttyy"
Who writes this junk..so when did Spiderman go to college and start carrying a cell phone this is for Dorks
This movie was an era of marvel that was a once in a life time experience.
The hand that was gonna catch MJ gave it all away
I think in the next Spiderman we get introduced to Miles Morales
Stupi&#39; spider .. i only watched half and then goodbye..
10 out of 10 movie .A Fucking masterpiece
"The end of that movie is brocken. Don&#39;t watch it, it is gonna ruin the past parts."
Trailer is still epic
Spider-Man 2 release it
That scene reminded  me of qwen falling in The amazing Spider-Man 2 😞 was Andrew in this? I didn&#39;t see him in the trailer and I haven&#39;t seen the movie yet I wish It was on Disney plus like other Spider-Man&#39;s movies are. And I look it up its on prime video and I don&#39;t have it.
"This movie is amazing, but I think an awesome post credit scene would have been if Peter (Andrew) walking down the street meets MJ (a new MJ of course) so the three Spidermans would have a MJ 👍"
"This movie blew my mind it was so awesome to see the actual original Peter Parker, I couldn&#39;t believe that all three spider mans were together and their bond was crazy.  I really love this movie  and it was entertaining from start to finish. One of the best spider man movies I have ever saw in my entire life. Love the work , I really do. 🤩😁😄"
I still watch this trailer feels like old days back 😍 hello petter<br>Still remember the first movie of spiderman when i was in school <br>Watching this take me back to those memories 😭
If only marvel included Henry’s character god that would’ve been crazy he would’ve been able to stop Osborn from stabbing Spider-Man
If there&#39;s going to be another spider man remake in the future  they should make it into a tv show. This the third remake
"I remember when the tickets were on sale, the first movie ticket I ever bought for myself btw, and the app for regal then suddenly was froze or was on a loading screen because of how many people were wanting tickets. But thankfully I got my tickets then. Man this movie was a master piece for marvel"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=163"">2:43</a> NARRATOR IS Awesome!"
The hype for this movie was on Infinity War level
no subtitles so i have no idea what&#39;s going on
"few months ago i believed nothing will top the hype of this movie, but kevin fiege announcing &quot;the kang dynasty&quot; and &quot;secret wars&quot; oooof 2025 is gonna be lovely."
Still goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥🔥
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=153"">2:33</a> I love the giveaway that it&#39;s Andrew not Tom"
No way home hype is second after Endgame in the whole world
Spiderman 4 is coming with tobey maguire
"Can someone explain to me why this bullshit movie causes so much euphoria. People who say that they cried, that they got chills, that it was the greatest experience of their lives. What kind of people are you?"
Sure this wasn&#39;t made by Disney? What a piece of comedic trash.<br><br>There are no decent producers or directors left!
Can&#39;t believe I cried so much when Peter was on the rooftop and when&#39;s saying his goodbyes. I really felt his pain.
If everyone is gonna suppose to dead while returning to there universe timeline...what is  the point to fix them??🤔🤔
"If everyone comes from multiverse who knows Peter Parker is Spiderman than, why not mj, Eddy Brock,Gwen,harry,Gwen father???"
Tobey Tobey Tobey 🖤✨🔥infact every one in theaters are shouting in his entry ⚡
Boring
Watched it at 8 in the morning after I woke up when it was released 🔥... still getting chills...what a time it was ❤️
"This gave me happy tears <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=155"">02:35</a>"
Im now in 2022 i watched it
"the day this trailer came out, everyone went nuts."
Spider-Man always been my hero 🥲🔥
Inpossble
"Finally watched this &quot;film&quot;.<br>Wow. What a ... &quot;thing&quot; this is, that was made."
What a load of cr@p 😂
"The film disappointed me, I was waiting for a real masterpiece and got a funny fan fiction from a youngsters"
For you Nickelodeon fans:<br>Chase (PAW Patrol: The Movie) - Tom<br>Ryder or Skye (PAW Patrol: The Movie) - MJ<br>Liberty (PAW Patrol: The Movie) - Ned<br>Splinter (TMNT)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Aang (AVATAR: The Last Airbender) - Andrew<br>SpongeBob SquarePants - Tobey
"I believe this film would never have been made had it not been for the pandemic. Schedules had to be cleared because no one knew when they would be back to work.<br><br>Fortunately, all of the big players were available to film and signed on. Thus No Way Home was made."
Damn black banter trailer at 46 million in less than 24 hours. I thought this would be the highest view trailer in record time.
"He is a little twit that Peter in this one, had he listened to Dr Cucumber , none of this grief would have happened and New York wouldn’t have to be destroyed so many times again! I’d hate to live in NY and pay for buildings insurance!"
"Watching the trailer again makes me nostalgic, it was one of the best experiences in my life that I will never forget, without a doubt the best movie"
What a days !
Even after watching the movie this trailer is amazzzziiinnng
"The story has no logic, three parallel universes, the characters who were killed at the moment before death were transferred through a portal to the same universe, and they have the possibility to repair themselves so that they do not die, if electro transferred at the moment of death and everyone else to that portal, how did gwen die When parallel events occur in similar ways. When The Amazing Spider-Man says: I lost Gwen, that was my M.J. she died 8 years ago. And events are like parallel worlds. This part changes the fate of the people from the previous parts, it changes the story. The best Spiderman was Amazing. Everyone saw that the evil characters died as well as the good ones, doesn&#39;t the fate of the killed people change, if the fight is not over, if it ends in Spiderman no back home, these characters become good, when they return to their parallel worlds and Spiderman there is no risk of fighting them, if norman died in the first part then spiderman 2 and 3 were filmed for no reason. Because the first part is parallel to this universe and Norman was transferred to this universe before his death. Dr. Octivius is looking for P.P. of old because he does not know what happened in the moment before he was submerged, he was transferred to this universe. Where they say the moment the power of the sun was in my palm I was transferred here. In my opinion, you should have corrected the story and continued filming P.P and Gwen. Because it is the best season of all.<br>This Spider-man is not good."
"Looking back at this trailer, it looks impossible for him to take on the 3 villains."
💖💝💖👏✨✨✨💯%so LOVE this movie esp wd the special cast included😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👌
It&#39;s not every day that a superhero gets to team up with other versions of themselves to battle the villains from other universes
That&#39;s all ur fault peter
This peter parker is trash. I mean I like Tom Holland. He is adorable and he can act but this Peter Parker/Spider Man character in this particular film is so horrible.
i watched that in netflix
Can we go back in time to experience the  incredible hype for this movie
One word to describe this film &quot;MASTERPIECE&quot;😭
This trailer still gives me chills!<br>I remember the reactions in the cinema...This movie was worth the wait!
&quot;Scooby-do this crap&quot;<br>I am going to cringe my spine out of my body
They fucked up spider man made it to childish really shit
So Jamseon is always attacking Spiderman yet he&#39;s not saying shiat against Thor or the others.<br>Guess its easier to pick on Spidy than a God.
"Ok, anyone else wanna go back in time to before the movie was out so we can experience the hype once more lol"
Who&#39;s here after watching the movie over and over again
"I loved the movie and the characters, but wished the final battle was more creative and had better lighting"
No Way Home is one of the Greatest achievement of humanity ❤️
I still come here to enjoy this trailer ♥️
Holy shit i only just noticed that was Andrew&#39;s spider mans hand at the end where Tom&#39;s was trying to save her.
Man I&#39;m so happy he want be spider man anymore hearing him speak while strange casted the spell smh stfu
This isn&#39;t just a movie. It&#39;s CINEMA.
"Ever time I see this trailer this blows my mind to the water and so much goosebumps,chills and suspension and green Goblin was a great Villan in this and now it was like a epic conclusion to the spider man and the movie is so fantastic from the beginning to the end 👏 still fantastic this year this trailer is the best trailer 👌"
this spiderman version is the dumbest
"True, I don&#39;t like this peter, too selfish"
Infinity War <br>Endgame <br>No Way Home <br>I am glad I am born in the right generation to witness such kind of masterpiece films of marvel.
This movie has way too much cgi. The backgrounds are so obvious. Really sad.
"Doctor: I am giving you a time machine that can be used 2 times 1 go to go to the time you want to go to, and 1 go to get back to this time.<br>Me: I&#39;m going to December 1st<br>Doctor: Why?<br>Me: Spiderman no way home and Christmas🙂"
The best superhero film of all time in my opinion 👌
Wow 7 months since this trailer came out. Time flies fast
"Just watched it on Netflix, mediocre film, just fan service, childish and splattered with stupid sometimes cringe worthy jokes. Dumb plot too. And this Spider-Man sure does not look 17 even though he is short😂. So glad I did not waste my money watching this forgettable stuff in cinema"
A great memory as the first Marvel film I have watched in theater... <br>Feels great
Im so glad i dont watch trailers anymore.... i get to be surprised 😄 i watch this after I watched the movie. And Its was much better not knowing.. 👊👊
watched this on netflix pretty good and sad and i always see a fricking jojo reference everytime i see a movie ;-;
"This was literally better than End Game, possibly even better than Infinity War, the crossover with the spidermen was better than any of the other heroes featuring small little nothingburger roles in other MCU movies, and this is the first one to ever actually incorporate more than ONE villain. Like cool there&#39;s all the heroes in avengers as they fight a bunch of faceless armies from whatever bad guys are in them. But this has multiple noteworthy villains AND they&#39;re actually given wayyy better character development than almost every other bad guy in the mcu that feels like a surface level villain in a cookie cutter movie. This was a peak moment and unless that &#39;Sinister Six&#39; movie that was having rumors about it was a separate thing from this I&#39;m not sure how many more MCU movies we&#39;ll get with more than one villain. Even Multiverse of Madness didn&#39;t measure up to this, it just had other hero cameos no villains, this was honestly a much better multiverse movie than that unfortunately, this is iconic."
Tobey and Andrew was not in no way home trailer
I waited a long time to get past all of the hype. This is just pure comic joy.
Ask anyone a decade ago that something like this would happen. They’d think you’re nuts!

Bad movie old spiderman was all better than this
Coming here almost eight months after the trailer dropped. Still get chills watching it. I wish we could relive the hype.
First off we have Mysterio telling everyone that Peter Parker&#39;s spiderman. And then Peter meets Dr Strange. Idk why Dr strange was in the movie. Peter meets the former villains. The villains go berserk. Aunt May is killed. Wasn&#39;t sad at all. Peter meets the two spidermen from different universes. They start attacking the villains and they bring them back to normal. Yay🙄. After that Peter asks Dr Strange to wash off everyone&#39;s memories. BAD ending. Overall this movie was mid.
This ending is so sad😭😭
Has someone made an edit of the trailer adding Tobey and Andrew? I’d love to rewatch the heck outta that
People asks why we won&#39;t get lots of cheers in Marvel movies nowadays after no way home.... <br>I say them this....<br><br><br>Marvel don&#39;t give what people want...<br>People wanted all Spiderman in the multiverse ... Sony gave them..

"Originally, they were thinking about including more characters from the other movies for this. They would&#39;ve included Kirsten Dunst&#39;s MJ, Emma Stones&#39; Gwen, Rhino from TASM2, Dane DeHaan&#39;s Green Goblin from TASM2, and even more of Tom Hardy&#39;s Venom. Mysterio was actually supposed to be brought in for a battle with Dr. Strange. I think maybe it could&#39;ve worked if this story was spilt into two movies like with Infinity War and Endgame. With that, Part 1 would be more of Tom&#39;s movie and it would end with him meeting Tobey and Andrew to get help which would set up the events of the sequel. But obviously they couldn&#39;t do more than one because of how Sony is currently doing those animated Spider-Verse movies and Across The Spider-Verse is going to be split into two movies themselves. I hope Tobey, Andrew, and Tom make an appearance in Part Two. Also, it would be really cool that another No Way Home is made with Tobey, Andrew, and Tom. But they should include the other characters that weren’t included. Michelle Jones would meet Mary Jane and could find out how she’s married to Tobey and that they are probably parents. Mary Jane could inspires Michelle to dye her hair red. They would also meet Gwen and find out how she was supposed to go to Oxford and Andrew would have a tearful reunion with her. When she goes back home, she will avoid her death. If TASM3 does happen, Shailene Woodley could make an appearance and Gwen will feel around her. In addition, Kirsten Dunst’s MJ will feel weird around Emma’s Gwen because of how she didn’t get along with Bryce Dallas Howard’s. We could see Dane DeHaan’s Harry get cured from his disease and he will be sorry for everything he did. Rhino could make an appearance, but in a real battle this time. Maybe Topher Grace and Tom Hardy could battle. It would be interesting to see what both of their symbiotes could do with each other. I don’t know if James Franco would return, but it would be a touching reunion with him, Tobey, and Kirsten on screen. Maybe Vulture, Shocker, and Mysterio could appear too. And since Vulture is teamed up with Morbius, I guess characters from the SSU would appear if Vulture is telling people Peter’s identity."

yo 2021 ended up to be a great year
The internet went insane that fall!!
I think it may be very grateful movie
"I cried butterfly tears 10,395 times."
and for the next spiderman.. maybe it will be more suitable to give the title spiderman: home alone
When nwh was abt to release i watched this trailer litr like 1000 times not even joking
after the I saw the movie all i could think is about the next one
"You know what, I&#39;m still hyped for this movie 😍"
Tobey Maguire spiderman should have walked into the MCU with a slice of pizza saying its pizza time or when all 3 spidermen were in the school lab and Tobey should have said pizza time to the other 2 spidermen this would have been epic Or if MJ was stood at the portal that Ned opened and she said go get them TIGER !!! Any of these ideas would have been epic
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=154"">02:34</a> the BGM music from here still gives me goosebumps!"
"In that time, the movie was good, now is shit"
They brought back all the old Spider-Mans. Shouldn&#39;t they bring back white MJ?
"🎬🎥👀 I always get Excited About Such Great Spectacular Movies To Watch ! Who Doesn&#39;t know Peter Parker rushing by on his web with his Spectacular Spider Speed...? Spiders somehow seems to have an appeal, and many People <br>(and the Occational Animal - as you can see on my Movie Blog -) find them Scarry...!  😎"
I remember this when I was going home from school and I saw this trailer and my mind was blown when I saw this trailer
I cied wnen ant may died 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
"If it&#39;s not because of covid, this movie can sell more than avangers"
"You can feel the epic “end of the world” vibes from the background music. And the way it’s all edited, with Electro and Sandman escaping the condo. Sony definitely doesn’t miss with their trailer music and epic finale vibes"
"The good old days, when the real struggle was getting an opening night ticket to this film 😩"
THE BEST SPIDER- MAN TRAILER ¡¡¡¡¡¡
Strange didn’t say “scooby do this crap” 🥲 ( it would’ve made such a good line if they would’ve changed it to “scooby do this shit”
"Behold, the 6th highest grossing movie of all time. The greatest movie since Avengers: Endgame"
Remember all the hype for the trailers and the movie 😭 tears of joy
So much chills
I still watch this trailer 🔥🔥
But max didn&#39;t know that spider man is peter parker
"I&#39;m so excited to see this trailer for the first time since watching the movie itself, to realize once again how much I&#39;d be missing out on watching them the other way around."
Next movie name it back yard of my house
I already miss the No Way Home hype in the theaters
Unbelievable that TASM2 could’ve been redeemed just by changing Electro’s design
Bro best movie ever for real! Watching this trailer again just gives me chills I will never have a night as good as the opening night of no way home
Wow i watched this movie again today..It still feels surreal...Man we some lucky ppl to witness this movie in theatres &lt;3
Did you know the “ we are happy to serve you cup” was first introduced in spider man 3. When tobey was in the hospital with harry. You can see him sitting down with the cup in his hands  waiting for the doctor to say something.
this had to be the best one 😭❤
Just imagine: This Movie almost didn‘t happen.
Spider-Man is a lot famous than any any hero. Even more famous than Ironman. Don&#39;t ever give Spider-Man to Disney. Spider-Man belong with Sony.
Will there be next spider man movie tooo .And will mj remember Peter
"Who else is excited for the “More Fun Stuff” version?<br><br><br><br><br>And later on, the Disney+ show “Spider-Man: Freshman Year”"
"Looking back at it, this movie did not live up to its hype (For me). I feel like it lacked heart and creativity, I know that it struggled during pandemic but…. I just can’t see it as a masterpiece because for me that title belongs and always will belong to Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 2 ♥️"
Spider-Man tries to be friendly to a larger neighborhood.
"from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=6"">0:06</a> it looks like peter is from GTA"
kind ironic how Dr Strange says “they all die fighting spiderman” when peter has a no kill rule.
"I&#39;ve seen the movie like a 100 times, but it still gives goosebumps while watching this trailer. I&#39;m saying this in 11/6/2022"
i have seen this full movie
I am so much excited to show Spiderman 4 because I listen that Spiderman 4 is coming soon on this statement of people I am so happy.
I have seen this 50 times
Spider-Man: No Way Home is slowly getting The Dark Knight status. It’s a grave sin to criticise that movie in public!
The fact that without Avengers Infinity War&#39;s Chinese gross this movie grossed more than it is hilarious. Imagine if this movie released in China. I think the gross will be somewhere near Titanic (1997). Which makes it 3rd highest-grossing movie of all time.
Idk what is happening to avengers. First Tony stark (the closest man to Peter Parker)died and now😔Peter Parker is forgotten from the world. I think this is the last movie of spider man[Peter parker]
"I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever forget the experience of watching this movie on opening day. At the time I had like 20% knowledge of spiderman, my first friend watched every single movie and was obsessed and my second knew absolutely nothing, but still, all of us were screaming at the theater like crazy. The movie is an absolute masterpiece."
This movie felt like it was written by Twitter.
This is what I don&#39;t get in spider-man no way home why not have everyone forget he&#39;s Spider-man instead of having them forget he&#39;s Peter Parker especially since he&#39;s not even done high school yet people will think he&#39;s some kind of new kid that just started there instead of someone who has been there the whole time.
hahaha...i dont know if this is the target trailer..but dang that one is funny....specially when we have the goofy retarded TOBEY.....who just HAS to ask....&quot;are u in a band?&quot;  i mean dude.....he is a great actor but just...wow lol.  an we have TOM i guess...who just gives this look like &quot;HUH??&quot;   this has to be the goofiest gayest movie..or trailer at least.... havent seen any of the new spider man movies besides the one with Garfield in it..but maybe this one....when its on tv.  wow
NAH BC THIS LOOKS SICK AND I CANT WATCH IT💀
I hope there is part 2 on this.
"Due to this being a masterpiece, There is a way home!!!"
That &quot;please&quot; line from Zendaya was hella funny for me for some reason🤦🏽‍♂️😂
It would be too cool if toby&#39;s and Andrew&#39;s spider end up in deadpool universe along with venom and eddy because of the multiverse commotion still not settled down.
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=142"">2:22</a> there were three spiderman in the movie but there is only one in the trailer 🎥🎦"
Fun Fact: Doctor has appeared every year since 2016(except for 2020 which was the Pandemic year)<br>2016-Doctor Strange<br>2017-Thor-Ragnorock<br>2018-Avengers-Infinity war<br>2019-Avengers-Endgame<br>2020-N/A<br>2021-Spiderman-No Way Home<br>2022-Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness
I like the other dude playing spider mannnnn 🥹
When a trailer gives away most of thr movie
This movie deserves to be called &quot;the best movie of all time&quot;
The greatest spiderman movie in history
Came back to watch the trailer after seeing the movie several times and still gives me goosebumps! Was so good!
BEST MOVIE EVER 🥺❤️❤️
Don’t ask who is here in 2022 2023 2027 2177 we ALLLL COMING TO SEE THIS. !! Tik we collapsed
HEY SONY PEOPLE <br>Could you please explain to me WHY ???? … Do you release the 3D Blu-ray version of both Spider-Man: Homecoming &amp; Spider-Man: Far from Home but NO 3D format for Spider-Man: No Way Home ??????<br><br>WHYYYYYY ???????
With no home comes no responsibilities.
"I remember waiting until 3 am for the trailer to drop. Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have been able to sleep, knowing that while I am sleeping the trailer is out! Omg, the hype for this movie was something else! (I had to wake up for school at 7 am 💀)"
WHAT A NICEEEEEEEE MOVIE😭😭😭😭
There is  no stanlee to see this<br>Don&#39;t copy this comment
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=20"">0:20</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=148"">2:28</a> screams don&#39;t actually happen because Zen doesn&#39;t have those vocal ranges. They used another sound effect, plus I watched it. I mean just listen when she talks, look at her Adam&#39;s apple. Weird and rare"
Spider-Man: No Way Home is the best non-Avengers movie in the MCU. Period.
I cant wait to see shaggy and the gang in Spider-Man Scooby doo ate our way home
I swear I keep on watching this movie every time but only the first half cuz the rest of the movie leaves me depressed
"6 months after the release of this movie I still rewatch this trailer in shock that this movie now exists, it is a literal dream come true seeing our childhood heroes and villains coming back to reprise their roles and to top it all off we see MCU Peter&#39;s insane development, this was and forever will be an unforgettable experience."
Who is the guy who appeared so many times?🤷🏻‍♂️
This video is 6 months now🥲
Tom Holland is the greatest gift to the MCU since Robert Downey Jr. Truly.
Spider-Man/Sonic the Hedgehog: No Way Home
1: Ben 10: No Way Home<br>2: Godzilla vs Kong: No Way Home<br>3: My Hero Academia: No Way Home<br>4: Sonic the Hedgehog: No Way Home
too complicated .....
I am angry at how stupid Peter Parker is. He is soooo naive. It made me skip some parts. Everything seemed so contrived.
Next level🔥🔥🔥
"For the next Spider-Man movie, i really really wanna see Chameleon and Scorpion! I mean Chameleon was the first villain that Spider-Man fought and Scorpion has yet not been on the big screen (at least not in costume)"
anyone over the age of 5 who unironically enjoys these &quot;films&quot; should be sterilised
Thor love and thunder trailer have dropped it....🤗
"update I just seen this now, and probably the movie seen Thor Ragnorok ..."
"Meanwhile,in another universe....Sony still showing such trailers and hiding of Andrew and tobey from fans🙂"
I watch this movie and then I watch trailer😅
Sonic the Hedgehog: No Way Home.<br>Sonics from other universes.<br>1: Movie Sonic.<br>2: Satam Sonic.<br>3: Anime Sonic.<br>4: Boom Sonic.<br>5: Archie Sonic (My top #1 favorite).<br>6: Fleetway Sonic.<br>7: Classic Sonic.<br>8: IDW Sonic.<br>9: Zonic the Zone Cop.<br>10: Multiverse Sonic.
Awesome baby love baby baby bye baby baby love baby baby bye l
worlds waits from 2007 for next one with sam raimi and tobey maguire to continue the story and travel to other universes with other 2 spidermans and miles morales and spider gwen to something like spider wars episodes from best anime series of 90&#39; with madame web!!!!!tobey maguire is the chosen one for sure!!!!!!!!!
im coming back here to relive the hype of this masterpiece that words cant describe honestly sensational and when norman said peter your struggling to have everything you want while the world tries to make you choose still gives me chills
Best Spidey movie ever in history
just watched this trailer and not sure i watched the movie or not.
Pretty good movie actually.
I hope tobey maguire is in this movie
"idk but, originally, it was:<br><br>WV &gt; MoM &gt; NWH, but due to the pandemic, there were delays. So it became WV &gt; NWH &gt; MoM<br><br>Maybe that’s why dr strange feels odd and too confident in NWH because he’s been corrupted by the darkhold, but the storyline shifted bc of pandemic?? 🤔"
Way better then Far From Good.
best character
imagine watching this movie without all these fucking leaks..
Infinity War and No Way Home are masterpieces
"It&#39;s weird seeing this bc I thought it would be a bit more complex,but it&#39;s still good"
bwuh craziest moment of my life
Can I please uplode spider man no way home on YouTube
"Honestly, movie was pretty terrible. I&#39;ve watched the old spiderman movies and loved seeing them communicate but I do not think that nostalgia can fuel this whole movie. Movie was still good but spiderman 2 is ten times better."
I cannot believe this trailer is six months old I legit member when this trailer first came out talk about memories 🥺
Imagine if they showed Tobey and Andrew landing there and they all leaped to attack them. Everyone watching this trailer would&#39;ve had a heart attack
People should understand that marvel ruined the spiderman character with worst story and graphics. Compare the Tsam 1 and Tasm 2 with Marvel spiderman movies. The graphics are worst 🤢🤮🤮🤮.
Green Goblin is the best
This movie is amazing mysterious and strange BUT VERY GOOD LOVED IT.the end part was so sad when will another spiderman will come pls reply waiting for it plss
This movie is so Amazing and insane i have watched it 9 times
I hate Green Goblin for killing Aunt May but still this was a really good movie I cried though
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=136"">2:16</a> I like how the 2 other Peters were edited out of the trailer in order to not spoil anything"
"H E L L O   P E T E R<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=51"">0:51</a><br><br>When he said that it remind me of the <br><br>SURPRISE MOTHERFVCKER"
Me 21 years old: This song was EPIC! <br>Me 90 years old: This song was EPIC! <br>Me as a GHOST: This song was EPIC! <br><br>                  <b>Marvel for life</b>
Im watching this movie right now and think it is HORRID!!!! the side kick friends DID NOTHING the whole movie that mattered.  Aunt may died for no reason. The two other spiderman are way better and have way better movies. BAD BAD MOVIE!! For anyone over 40 this movie sucked and was for kids who don;t know what good movies are.
Lol if only he just kept his mouth shut. He literally just ignores what Dr. strange is telling him during the spell. Lol
"It felt amazing at first, but now I&#39;m starting to notice the immense amount of potholes. This movie really was just a cash grab."
I now have some understanding on how it felt to know that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker&#39;s father while watching the movie. Too bad for most people who will watch this movie for the first time later would most likely know about the spoiler
"I thought there would be a post-credit scene for the latest Spider-Man movie, which seems like a wasted opportunity, they could have shown what happened to one of the Spider-Man variants or their villains from their perspective back to their timeline, or show a cameo of Nicholas Hammond as Spider-Man missing the fight like Tom Hardy as Venom missed it"
Around the planet
this movie was hot trash 😂
Most idiotic movie ever made by Marvel
Spoilers- <br>At first I liked this movie so much but the more I think about it the more I&#39;m becoming disappointed.<br>Specially Peter (Tom) kept pissing me off.<br>I don&#39;t know why MC kept him making stupid and annoying mistakes. Ik he&#39;s Young and new but still.<br>One time they&#39;ll make him super intelligent and the next moment they&#39;ll make him super dumb.<br>Also it was quite confusing. Cause in end game Hulk said that changing the past won&#39;t change what happened. So how Peter changing the villains will change whatever happen to them? <br>And if it worked then in endgame killing baby Thanos should work as well😑<br>Idk. I can be wrong.<br>But still it&#39;s a good movie. And movies don&#39;t go well with logic so sorry for my rant<br>Sorry for bad English.
5 months later and this trailer still gets me hyped up!
Why tobey and andrew are not here?
This movie was so good that it makes the trailer look lame lol
Spiderman one of my favourite movie characters💝❤️
Here after moon knight and the greatest MOM 🔥💠❤️<br><br> MARVEL STILL NOT DEAD 💥☠️
STREAM BUTYOU MV any iKON
Definitely the best theater  experience I’ve  ever had with a movie!! 10/10 Wish I can go back in time to experience it again 😭😭
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=135"">2:15</a> -<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=140"">2:20</a> after seeing the film, everyone would agree that the trailer gave us the best biggest thing of the moment of the 3 spideys and the villians have a crazy battle shot<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=148"">2:28</a> after seeing the film, still is so hyped of the ultimate tease of andrew Garfield saving zendaya."
This movie was mid
Both Spiderman No Way Home and Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!<br>10/10 Best movie so far in 2021 and 2022!!! F*ck the haters!!!
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=76"">1:16</a> it says “scooby doo this crap” but in the movie it’s says “scooby doo this sh**”"
Love it 😻
Anyone back here after Multiverse of Madness?
Please someone ask MCU to getting out spiderman by the neck from Marvel Cinematic Universe. He is just a headache for everyone. 😡😡
I wish multiverse of madness had lived up to this hype
I still come back to watch trailers to get hyped again 😂😂
Doc Ock&#39;s entry was the coolest🥺❤️
"“You’re not Peter”<br><br>Peter: “Good, the forgetting spell worked well”"
where is the extended cut
"Best part <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=123"">2:03</a>"
"After watching this film, i was sad I lost 2 hours for such an stupid film. I was curious about how people thought on the movie.... People do like this film. Then an understand the makers of the movie does understand An know the brain level of the people who do look to these films. The new generation is brainswashed and do not have the need to use their brains. Im sad for their enslived future."
I have this weird habit of watching this every now and then because it still gets me hyped.
Settling down for the night 🌙 😴 😌 ✨
omg it&#39;s that guy from fortnite!1!1!1!!1
The movie came out 5 months ago but here you are back to relive the hype of this trailer.
"It would have been so much much amazing if peter would not have that idea, I mean it was an idea to connect the spider verse in to it"
