Aunt may dies<br>3. Tobey and Andrew show up in his verse <br>4. Saddest.. everyone forgets Peter Parker like everyone which leads that everyone again forgets the identity of spider man and thus Peter Parker is completely alone in his life 😥😢",True
Movie was alright. They literally only fought the big villains and no smaller criminals which i found very boring. The CGI looked crap at some points like when jamie foxx&#39;s arms looked like rubber/plastic while he was hovering in the air. I feel like tobey and andrew should have gotten out of the portals in a more dramatic way. Its for sure a movie that has to be watched but for me i will only watch it once since it really feeled like that all the money went into getting all 3 spidermans together. This movie all in all felt like an excuse to bring all 3 together to grab some cash. There was literally no point in jake gyllenhal revealing the identity of spiderman...like at all.,True
"NO VALE LA PENA PAGAR PARA VER ESA PELICULA !! Una de las peores películas de Spiderman ,me pregunto quien elige ciertos actores como Mary Jane que mujer cero personalidad carisma etc no trasmite nada no parece la novia y si la  hermana de Peter (me pregunto con quien sale o es hija mmm🤔🤔 ),la primera ya era  aburrida y clásica santita bien vestida pero es la que  se come a todos kk y Peter como perrito atrás .Muchos chistes bobos ,aburridos dramas y lloradera ,una historia&quot; pobre&quot; muy predecible lo dejaron a Doctor Strange como un mago bobo que hace caso de un inmaduro y sus caprichos aff  ,es una película echa para los pocos pensantes y críticos para los fanáticos que consumen cualquier cosa con tal de ver sus ídolos .

"I see a lot of people saying this movie is a masterpiece, calling this movie a masterpiece just for the fact that all 3 spiderman appeared is just nonsense, this movie is extremely badly written, I&#39;m not saying it is a bad movie, seeing the 3 spiderman unite is quite unique, however the movie relies heavily on nostalgia, that&#39;s the only thing that makes it good, take away Garfield and Maguire and it will just be a regular movie with bad CGI and a poorly written plot... comparing this to actual masterpieces should be ilegal",True
Dr. strange has the strongest domain expansion.,True
"I swear each Spider-Man film, most of Peter’s sufferings are self-inflicted.

We have the impression that the spider-man is written to entertain the gallery, young children. For the budget put in I admit to being surprised. <b>People see Marvel and are unable to judge the movie</b> as if it came out of an independent studio. It’s not far from a 2/5 I think. After those who put a 4.2/5 put a 2.5/5 to the new James Bond (75% real scene)... It’s hard to judge a movie but try to figure out how to film, do a VFX, 3D and you’ll be able to recalculate",True

I don’t like the fact his aunt was murdered because of his choice . I don’t like the fact the writer set an example that is not realistic . The moral of the movie for me was if you are being robbed by a criminal give the criminal the keys to your car to drive away with  , open your door and let the criminal in your home and assist them with stealing your property. If your family gets hurt in the process it’s ok because you must be kind all the time even if you are being violently attacked are robbed. STUPID CONCEPT !",True

Not sure if it is the bad writing or the fact that Tom Holland is the worst of the three last Spiderman characters.   The line of laughing at Dr Otto&#39;s name is just lame .. high school level writing.. asking please hahaha.. .it is just so bad... and in the previous movie Peter Parker acts like he is a high school nerd with nothing going for him and yet previously he helped save the world.. and still he is insecure?   All of it is really the worst writing and the worst Spiderman version.   I hope he is replaced.   Tobey Maquire played the role much better.  The only difference in 2021 is the special effects,True

"This movie looks so dumb. Looks like the spiderman version of end game. i don&#39;t know why people watch Marvel movies when they all have the same story and plot all the time. I was forced to watch end game and that was a crap movie and I am sure this one will be another steaming pile of dung. When Hollywood does make a masterpiece like Passengers, people rarely talk about it or even understand the message of the movie. These marvel movies are like pop music. Produced with a formula to sell to the masses and released at times like the summer break or near Christmas so people will go watch it anyways cause they more time on their hands. All right that&#39;s my time...I&#39;m out.",True

"Small spoiler(insignificant) from No way home:<br>The last spider-man movie was phenomenal, but i was pretty sad for Andrew&#39;s spider-man.<br>With Tobey&#39;s we at least got a little consolation that he and MJ are still  together, through good and bad times, after all these years.<br>For Andrew&#39;s spider-man we didn&#39;t get such a resolution.<br>A part of me wanted Strange to bend some law&#39;s and maybe send Andrew back to his timeline at the moment he and the goblin fought their last battle..We didn&#39;t need anything big.<br><br>Just a small cutscene of 15 seconds, with Andrew&#39;s spider-man being teleported in the middle of the fight, him having a small realization and being grateful and thankful .We don&#39;t need to see the fight. We just need to see him charge and we&#39;ll now he won&#39;t fail a second time.<br>That would&#39;ve been a wonderful and needed closure to his character.<br>Of course, i would be all for a third TAS spider-man.",True

"I need to clarify something since it seems everyone keeps talking about it. in either the comments or on &quot;breakdowns&quot; of the trailer. <br><br>So this apparent &quot;new black suit&quot; thats in the trailor, some people have said  its from Dr.Strange, I&#39;m guessing cause we see the strange type eldritch magic, but its not &quot;new&quot; or &quot;from doctor strange&quot;. It&#39;s peters regular iron spider armor from Tony Stark, it&#39;s just turned inside out. The suit is black cause it&#39;s the interior and the gold is some sort of tech wiring. If you look closely you can even see some sort of cables coming from different areas, and his phone is tapped to his chest. I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s always been taped there so Ned can continue to be &quot;the guy in the chair&quot; even without access to coms and we&#39;ve never noticed cause its (of course) taped inside the suit, but I&#39;m just guessing on that part. Now, why it&#39;s turned inside out I&#39;m not sure, and that&#39;s only one thing that gets me stoked for this movie.",True
