MOVIE REVIEW br       Spider Man No Way Home is the third movie in the Spider Man trilogy starring Tom Holland As a warning going forward this review will contain spoilers In this story of action love and selfsacrifice Peter Parker a seemingly ordinary high school senior faces several trials after his identity as Spider Man is revealed to the public When his new reputation threatens his chances of being accepted into college with the help of Dr Strange he tries to cast a spell that will cause the world to forget that he is Spider Man However Peter messes up the spell and accidentally brings villains from various universes into his own universe With the help of Dr Strange his friends and heroes from the other universes Peter makes an honorable sacrifice and saves the world from the villains         I thought that this movie was incredibly enjoyable The film itself was skillfully developed with an interesting plot talented actors and impressive cinematography One aspect of the plot that I especially appreciated was the balance of action and dialogue within the movie each which added to the progression of the storyline The plot also has a relevant and inspiring message about the importance of doing what is right and the nobleness of selfsacrifice Although none of the characters always make the right choices the film makes it clear how their good choices bring more positivity into their situations while their rash or unethical decisions negatively impact them When they make bad decisions the nonrepentant characters such as the villains are defeated while the ones who work to correct their mistakes although they may suffer are victorious This conveys the message that even when people make bad decisions there is merit in persevering and striving for what is good  For example when Peter disobeys Dr Strange the villains come into the universe and threaten his city However when Peter recognizing that he was wrong takes responsibility for his disobedience and chooses to work with others in an attempt to stop the villains it has a positive impact on the world that he is striving to protect Throughout the film several characters such as Peter Parker Aunt May and MJ have to make difficult decisions that involve significant sacrifice It is a truthfilled film that acknowledges and has an appropriate attitude towards the beauty of the virtuous actions of Peter Parker and his friends and the ugliness of any actions motivated by the evil intentions of the villains Even though the film has a fictional plot the moral themes within the movie as well as the virtuous actions of the characters can be influential to todays society I also appreciated how the movie respected the dignity of the human person Although there was death within the movie particularly the death of Aunt May the movie acknowledged the tragedy of her death appropriately and honored the sacrifice that she made One aspect of the movie that I did not appreciate was that there was some unnecessary language However overall I found Spider Man No Way Home to be an impressive film production,positive,"['MOVIE', 'REVIEW', 'br', '      ', 'Spider', 'Man', 'Way', 'Home',

Originally they were thinking about including more characters from the other movies for this They would've included Kirsten Dunst's MJ Emma Stones' Gwen Rhino from TASM2 Dane DeHaan's Green Goblin from TASM2 and even more of Tom Hardy's Venom Mysterio was actually supposed to be brought in for a battle with Dr Strange I think maybe it could've worked if this story was spilt into two movies like with Infinity War and Endgame With that Part 1 would be more of Tom's movie and it would end with him meeting Tobey and Andrew to get help which would set up the events of the sequel But obviously they couldn't do more than one because of how Sony is currently doing those animated SpiderVerse movies and Across The SpiderVerse is going to be split into two movies themselves I hope Tobey Andrew and Tom make an appearance in Part Two Also it would be really cool that another No Way Home is made with Tobey Andrew and Tom But they should include the other characters that werent included Michelle Jones would meet Mary Jane and could find out how shes married to Tobey and that they are probably parents Mary Jane could inspires Michelle to dye her hair red They would also meet Gwen and find out how she was supposed to go to Oxford and Andrew would have a tearful reunion with her When she goes back home she will avoid her death If TASM3 does happen Shailene Woodley could make an appearance and Gwen will feel around her In addition Kirsten Dunsts MJ will feel weird around Emmas Gwen because of how she didnt get along with Bryce Dallas Howards We could see Dane DeHaans Harry get cured from his disease and he will be sorry for everything he did Rhino could make an appearance but in a real battle this time Maybe Topher Grace and Tom Hardy could battle It would be interesting to see what both of their symbiotes could do with each other I dont know if James Franco would return but it would be a touching reunion with him Tobey and Kirsten on screen Maybe Vulture Shocker and Mysterio could appear too And since Vulture is teamed up with Morbius I guess characters from the SSU would appear if Vulture is telling people Peters identity,neutral,"['Originally', 'thinking', 'including', 'characters', 'movies', 'included', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'MJ', 'Emma', 'Stones', 'Gwen', 'Rhino', 'TASM2', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'TASM2', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Venom', 'Mysterio', 'actually', 'supposed', 'brought', 'battle', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'think', 'maybe', 'worked', 'story', 'spilt', 'movies', 'like', 'Infinity', 'War', 'Endgame', '1', 'Tom', 'movie', 'end', 'meeting', 'Tobey', 'Andrew', 'help', 'set', 'events', 'sequel', 'obviously', 'Sony', 'currently', 'animated', 'SpiderVerse', 'movies', 'SpiderVerse', 'going', 'split', 'movies', 'hope', 'Tobey', 'Andrew', 'Tom', 'appearance', 'cool', 'Way', 'Home', 'Tobey', 'Andrew', 'Tom', 'include', 'characters', 'nt', 'included', 'Michelle', 'Jones', 'meet', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'find', 's', 'married', 'Tobey', 'probably', 'parents', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'inspires', 'Michelle', 'dye', 'hair', 'red', 'meet', 'Gwen', 'find', 'supposed', 'Oxford', 'Andrew', 'tearful', 'reunion', 'goes', 'home', 'avoid', 'death', 'TASM3', 'happen', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'appearance', 'Gwen', 'feel', 'addition', 'Kirsten', 'Dunsts', 'MJ', 'feel', 'weird', 'Emmas', 'Gwen', 'nt', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howards', 'Dane', 'DeHaans', 'Harry', 'cured', 'disease', 'sorry', 'Rhino', 'appearance', 'real', 'battle', 'time', 'Maybe', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'battle', 'interesting', 'symbiotes', 'nt', 'know', 'James', 'Franco', 'return', 'touching', 'reunion', 'Tobey', 'Kirsten', 'screen', 'Maybe', 'Vulture', 'Shocker', 'Mysterio', 'appear', 'Vulture', 'teamed', 'Morbius', 'guess', 'characters', 'SSU', 'appear', 'Vulture', 'telling', 'people', 'Peters', 'identity']",originally think include character movie include Kirsten Dunst MJ Emma Stones Gwen Rhino TASM2 Dane DeHaan Green Goblin TASM2 Tom Hardy Venom Mysterio actually suppose bring battle Dr Strange think maybe work story spilt movie like Infinity War Endgame 1 Tom movie end meet Tobey Andrew help set event sequel obviously Sony currently animate SpiderVerse movie SpiderVerse going split movie hope Tobey Andrew Tom appearance cool Way Home Tobey Andrew Tom include character not include Michelle Jones meet Mary Jane find s marry Tobey probably parent Mary Jane inspire Michelle dye hair red meet Gwen find suppose Oxford Andrew tearful reunion go home avoid death TASM3 happen Shailene Woodley appearance Gwen feel addition Kirsten dunst MJ feel weird Emmas Gwen not Bryce Dallas howard dane DeHaans Harry cure disease sorry rhino appearance real battle time maybe Topher Grace Tom Hardy battle interesting symbiote not know James Franco return touching reunion Tobey Kirsten screen maybe Vulture Shocker Mysterio appear Vulture team Morbius guess character SSU appear vulture tell people Peters identity

The movie is already 1 year old It definitely shows a sad face of our reality anyone whom is accused of something or under suspicion people are ready to turn on them and get violent brPeter is facing a true struggle is it true everywhere SpiderMan goes chaos and calamity ensues Whatever damage is left behind we have to pick up the pieces brCan you actually fix someone we should give people second chances to start over rather than meet our fate a simple solution isnt the only solution can we do more than expect disappointment therefore avoiding disappointment morality isnt a weakness revenge never makes anything better brAfter 20 years I can safely say this was absolutely worth that wait  Intense action the stakes are the highest they've ever been for SpiderMan and there's a ton of heavy emotional beats I wasn't ready for brTerrific to see past actors come back from previous franchises and lots of nods to the culture of the character even Green Goblin gets more exploration trying to suppress his dual personality but with little success plus Electro gets a good course correction since his birth and Doc Ock is offered a way out without being power hungry with his hubris more sympathy for these individuals rather than being straight up bad guys brMore stuff centering about rehabilitation as opposed to just jailing up people  I wish more of the villains were explored further  but the film delivers enough for longtime fans plus it's the best acted from Tom Holland as this current version brHe really does bring the central core of the character full circle with sorrow guilt regret and being responsible brLove how Ned gets to be more proactive next to MJ too brThe climax is astounding visually and emotionally  I am curious how future movies will benefit from this now that Marvel and Sony are finally collaborating  brThe movie is about looking backwards but learning to go forwards and there will always be consequences trying to change things or set things right not to mention showing the test of what it means to be a hero let alone what it costs sacrifice and sparing others pain brDirector Jon Watts closes this cycle of SpiderMan movies with quite a jolt not forgetting the human drama exciting fights and embracing the colorful fun of the comics brBest movie of 2021 and one of the best SpiderMan movies period,positive,"['movie', '1', 'year',

I just watched this for the first time 2 days ago Honestly got fed up of the superhero stuff But that's all tv has on it these days so got sucked in It was excellent thought I'd come read comments and realized that some many don't feel the same  So decided to comment to put things in perspective See i saw the first spidermen in cinema There was hype All we had before this eas batman and superman movies Xmen also just took off These were cartoons that we grew up with that shaped us in more ways than we knew so it was important to us to see these characters come to life on the big screen brTobey was our first spiderman We didn't have internet like we do now with data and cellphones so for us he just vanished And was replaced by Andrew And then 2 movies later Another spiderman  Each director told us a story In their own way And because they each remembered things differently There were differences  And we were asked to forget the previous movies Because it was like a slate being wiped clean and irrelevant to the current happenings  This was a breaking of the fourth wall for us  By having them break the third The only other time this happened XMen first class mystique   So yes There was a great deal of hype Because then unlike now we didn't expect that it would have been the last time for us to see either of them as spiderman again  brStated another way Imagine 70 years from now A reboot of James Cameron's titanic But the old lady telling the story is kate Winslet  Or 19 years from now An ironman reboot With Robert Downey Jr  Or perhaps my best example yet A strange world where heath ledger and Joachin Phoenix square off against keaton and  kilmer Or all the bond actors together in one film See It's impossible   With this film Hollywood did the impossible brOh And fyi It's the XMen and spiderman that made enough money and got the MCU happening Because it was profitable and people wanted more  Compared to hulk green lantern and a lot of other shitty superhero movies along the way Yes lantern is DC but my point is the real world isn't isolated like that They're all one big genre  Goblin Oc Those characters died on us And we felt it So to see them in the ORIGINAL format  We fans were done justicea proper homage They brought 3 generations of spiderman fans together in a way I don't see happening anytime soon until XMen finds it's
