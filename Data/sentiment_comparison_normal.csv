"Just watched it on Netflix, mediocre film, just fan service, childish and splattered with stupid sometimes cringe worthy jokes. Dumb plot too. And this Spider-Man sure does not look 17 even though he is short????. So glad I did not waste my money watching this forgettable stuff in cinema",negative,neutral

"It sounds just like another one of those confused movies that don&#39;t know where they want to go or what they want to be. I got so bored watching this intro I went to the kitchen before it even finished, and that&#39;s not easy to happen... Marvel movies are like Dragonball. When they start out, they make sense, but then they try to gradually become more and more &quot;epic&quot; until they just make no sense and there&#39;s nothing in them we can even relate to any longer. It&#39;s just a pure mess of exaggeration with no defined direction or meaning.",negative,positive

"MOVIE REVIEW <br>       Spider Man: No Way Home is the third movie in the Spider Man trilogy starring Tom Holland. As a warning, going forward this review will contain spoilers. In this story of action, love, and self-sacrifice, Peter Parker, a seemingly ordinary high school senior, faces several trials after his identity as Spider Man is revealed to the public. When his new reputation threatens his chances of being accepted into college, with the help of Dr. Strange, he tries to cast a spell that will cause the world to forget that he is Spider Man. However, Peter messes up the spell and accidentally brings villains from various universes into his own universe. With the help of Dr. Strange, his friends, and heroes from the other universes, Peter makes an honorable sacrifice and saves the world from the villains. <br><br>       I thought that this movie was incredibly enjoyable. The film itself was skillfully developed with an interesting plot, talented actors, and impressive cinematography. One aspect of the plot that I especially appreciated was the balance of action and dialogue within the movie, each which added to the progression of the storyline. The plot also has a relevant and inspiring message about the importance of doing what is right and the nobleness of self-sacrifice. Although none of the characters always make the right choices, the film makes it clear how their good choices bring more positivity into their situations while their rash or unethical decisions negatively impact them. When they make bad decisions, the non-repentant characters, such as the villains, are defeated while the ones who work to correct their mistakes, although they may suffer, are victorious. This conveys the message that even when people make bad decisions, there is merit in persevering and striving for what is good.  For example, when Peter disobeys Dr. Strange, the villains come into the universe and threaten his city. However, when Peter, recognizing that he was wrong, takes responsibility for his disobedience and chooses to work with others in an attempt to stop the villains, it has a positive impact on the world that he is striving to protect. Throughout the film, several characters, such as Peter Parker, Aunt May, and MJ, have to make difficult decisions that involve significant sacrifice. It is a truth-filled film that acknowledges and has an appropriate attitude towards the beauty of the virtuous actions of Peter Parker and his friends and the ugliness of any actions motivated by the evil intentions of the villains. Even though the film has a fictional plot, the moral themes within the movie as well as the virtuous actions of the characters can be influential to todayÃ??s society. I also appreciated how the movie respected the dignity of the human person. Although there was death within the movie, particularly the death of Aunt May, the movie acknowledged the tragedy of her death appropriately and honored the sacrifice that she made. One aspect of the movie that I did not appreciate was that there was some unnecessary language. However, overall, I found Spider Man: No Way Home to be an impressive film production.",positive,positive

"This was literally better than End Game, possibly even better than Infinity War, the crossover with the spidermen was better than any of the other heroes featuring small little nothingburger roles in other MCU movies, and this is the first one to ever actually incorporate more than ONE villain. Like cool there&#39;s all the heroes in avengers as they fight a bunch of faceless armies from whatever bad guys are in them. But this has multiple noteworthy villains AND they&#39;re actually given wayyy better character development than almost every other bad guy in the mcu that feels like a surface level villain in a cookie cutter movie. This was a peak moment and unless that &#39;Sinister Six&#39; movie that was having rumors about it was a separate thing from this I&#39;m not sure how many more MCU movies we&#39;ll get with more than one villain. Even Multiverse of Madness didn&#39;t measure up to this, it just had other hero cameos no villains, this was honestly a much better multiverse movie than that unfortunately, this is iconic.",positive,negative

I donâÃÃ´t like the fact his aunt was murdered because of his choice . I donâÃÃ´t like the fact the writer set an example that is not realistic . The moral of the movie for me was if you are being robbed by a criminal give the criminal the keys to your car to drive away with  , open your door and let the criminal in your home and assist them with stealing your property. If your family gets hurt in the process itâÃÃ´s ok because you must be kind all the time even if you are being violently attacked are robbed. STUPID CONCEPT !",negative,negative

"The ability of the Spider-Man films to portray Peter Parker&#39;s dual lifeÃ??that of an apparently normal teenager juggling the extraordinary responsibilities of being a superheroÃ??is one of their most notable features. The struggle to strike a balance between one&#39;s personal life and one&#39;s responsibilities as a crime-fighting vigilante, whether played by Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, or Tom Holland, is a recurring theme in the films. Because it captures the universal struggle of juggling conflicting facets of one&#39;s life, this theme appeals to audiences.Filmmakers can now vividly depict Spider-Man&#39;s web-slinging stunts and fights against strong adversaries thanks to advancements in visual effects. Movies featuring superhero action sequences that go beyond swinging through New York City skyscrapers and taking on legendary villains like Venom, Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, and the Vulture have set a higher standard.Furthermore, what sets Spider-Man movies apart is how moral quandaries and the human side of superheroes are portrayed. Audiences are deeply impacted by Peter Parker&#39;s internal struggles, his desire to do good, and the sacrifices he makes for the greater good. In conclusion, by fusing exciting action, gripping narrative, and likable characters, Spider-Man films have irrevocably altered the film industry. These movies, which feature everyone&#39;s favorite amiable neighborhood superhero, never fail to enthrall audiences, whether they&#39;re swinging across cityscapes or navigating life&#39;s challenges.",positive,positive

Not sure if it is the bad writing or the fact that Tom Holland is the worst of the three last Spiderman characters.   The line of laughing at Dr Otto&#39;s name is just lame .. high school level writing.. asking please hahaha.. .it is just so bad... and in the previous movie Peter Parker acts like he is a high school nerd with nothing going for him and yet previously he helped save the world.. and still he is insecure?   All of it is really the worst writing and the worst Spiderman version.   I hope he is replaced.   Tobey Maquire played the role much better.  The only difference in 2021 is the special effects,negative,positive

Movie was alright. They literally only fought the big villains and no smaller criminals which i found very boring. The CGI looked crap at some points like when jamie foxx&#39;s arms looked like rubber/plastic while he was hovering in the air. I feel like tobey and andrew should have gotten out of the portals in a more dramatic way. Its for sure a movie that has to be watched but for me i will only watch it once since it really feeled like that all the money went into getting all 3 spidermans together. This movie all in all felt like an excuse to bring all 3 together to grab some cash. There was literally no point in jake gyllenhal revealing the identity of spiderman...like at all.,negative,positive

"The story has no logic, three parallel universes, the characters who were killed at the moment before death were transferred through a portal to the same universe, and they have the possibility to repair themselves so that they do not die, if electro transferred at the moment of death and everyone else to that portal, how did gwen die When parallel events occur in similar ways. When The Amazing Spider-Man says: I lost Gwen, that was my M.J. she died 8 years ago. And events are like parallel worlds. This part changes the fate of the people from the previous parts, it changes the story. The best Spiderman was Amazing. Everyone saw that the evil characters died as well as the good ones, doesn&#39;t the fate of the killed people change, if the fight is not over, if it ends in Spiderman no back home, these characters become good, when they return to their parallel worlds and Spiderman there is no risk of fighting them, if norman died in the first part then spiderman 2 and 3 were filmed for no reason. Because the first part is parallel to this universe and Norman was transferred to this universe before his death. Dr. Octivius is looking for P.P. of old because he does not know what happened in the moment before he was submerged, he was transferred to this universe. Where they say the moment the power of the sun was in my palm I was transferred here. In my opinion, you should have corrected the story and continued filming P.P and Gwen. Because it is the best season of all.<br>This Spider-man is not good.",negative,negative

This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it canÃ??t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art IÃ??ve come across in my life, and IÃ??m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don&#39;t think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life.

When Hollywood does make a masterpiece like Passengers, people rarely talk about it or even understand the message of the movie. These marvel movies are like pop music.

"I used to be a great fan of spider man movies, that is, of the first three, with tobey macguire. Theses last movies are so bad. They want to be cool, and trendy. Both the movie and the characters are so annoying, wanting to be cool everytime, and they want  to break sipder-man tradition, with all these Leftism/LGBT agenda&#39;s cliches, that it ends so FAKE, and iritating. Thes last spider man remind me those adolecent movies of the 80s, filled with cliches. Now they are packed with 2020&#39;s cliches, like the constant usage of smart phones, and people trying to look cool... they want to give the impression that super heros could be something normal in our society, that it ends sounding so fony... In fact, I cannot watch more than 5 minutes of these new super-heros new films, not even to watch the great special CGI effects... so much money spent in these crappy movies.",negative,positive

"Originally, they were thinking about including more characters from the other movies for this. They would&#39;ve included Kirsten Dunst&#39;s MJ, Emma Stones&#39; Gwen, Rhino from TASM2, Dane DeHaan&#39;s Green Goblin from TASM2, and even more of Tom Hardy&#39;s Venom. Mysterio was actually supposed to be brought in for a battle with Dr. Strange. I think maybe it could&#39;ve worked if this story was spilt into two movies like with Infinity War and Endgame. With that, Part 1 would be more of Tom&#39;s movie and it would end with him meeting Tobey and Andrew to get help which would set up the events of the sequel. But obviously they couldn&#39;t do more than one because of how Sony is currently doing those animated Spider-Verse movies and Across The Spider-Verse is going to be split into two movies themselves. I hope Tobey, Andrew, and Tom make an appearance in Part Two. Also, it would be really cool that another No Way Home is made with Tobey, Andrew, and Tom. But they should include the other characters that werenÃ??t included. Michelle Jones would meet Mary Jane and could find out how sheÃ??s married to Tobey and that they are probably parents. Mary Jane could inspires Michelle to dye her hair red. They would also meet Gwen and find out how she was supposed to go to Oxford and Andrew would have a tearful reunion with her. When she goes back home, she will avoid her death. If TASM3 does happen, Shailene Woodley could make an appearance and Gwen will feel around her. In addition, Kirsten DunstÃ??s MJ will feel weird around EmmaÃ??s Gwen because of how she didnÃ??t get along with Bryce Dallas HowardÃ??s. We could see Dane DeHaanÃ??s Harry get cured from his disease and he will be sorry for everything he did. Rhino could make an appearance, but in a real battle this time. Maybe Topher Grace and Tom Hardy could battle. It would be interesting to see what both of their symbiotes could do with each other. I donÃ??t know if James Franco would return, but it would be a touching reunion with him, Tobey, and Kirsten on screen. Maybe Vulture, Shocker, and Mysterio could appear too. And since Vulture is teamed up with Morbius, I guess characters from the SSU would appear if Vulture is telling people PeterÃ??s identity.",neutral,negative

Cause in end game Hulk said that changing the past won&#39;t change what happened.

If your family gets hurt in the process itâÃÃ´s ok because you must be kind all the time even if you are being violently attacked are robbed. STUPID CONCEPT !",negative,negative

"I just watched this for the first time 2 days ago... Honestly got fed up of the superhero stuff... But that&#39;s all tv has on it these days.. so got sucked in..<br><br>It was excellent.. thought I&#39;d come read comments and realized that some (many) don&#39;t feel the same... <br><br>So decided to comment.. to put things in perspective.<br><br>See i saw the first spidermen in cinema... There was hype... All we had before this eas batman and superman movies... Xmen also just took off... These were cartoons that we grew up with that shaped us in more ways than we knew.. so it was important to us to see these characters come to life on the big screen...<br><br><br>Tobey was our first spiderman... We didn&#39;t have internet like we do now with data and cellphones.. so for us.. he just vanished... And was replaced by Andrew... And then 2 movies later... Another spiderman... <br><br>Each director told us a story... In their own way... And because they each remembered things differently... There were differences... <br><br>And we were asked to forget the previous movies... Because it was like a slate being wiped clean and irrelevant to the current happenings... <br><br>This was a breaking of the fourth wall for us...  By having them break the third...<br><br>The only other time this happened?? X-Men first class (mystique). <br><br>... So yes... There was a great deal of hype... Because then unlike now.. we didn&#39;t expect that it would have been the last time for us to see either of them as spiderman again... <br><br><br>Stated another way... Imagine 70 years from now... A reboot of James Cameron&#39;s titanic.... But the old lady telling the story is kate Winslet <br><br>Or 19 years from now... An ironman reboot... With Robert Downey Jr. <br><br>Or perhaps my best example yet.... A strange world where heath ledger and Joachin Phoenix square off against keaton and  kilmer.<br><br>Or all the bond actors together in one film...<br><br>See.... It&#39;s impossible... .... ... With this film Hollywood did the impossible<br><br><br>Oh! And fyi... It&#39;s the X-Men and spiderman that made enough money and got the MCU happening... Because it was profitable and people wanted more... <br><br>Compared to hulk, green lantern, and a lot of other shitty superhero movies along the way<br><br>(Yes lantern is DC.. but my point is the real world isn&#39;t isolated like that... They&#39;re all one big genre)<br><br>.... Goblin... Oc... Those characters died on us... And we felt it... So to see them.. in the ORIGINAL format....  We fans were done justice...a proper homage. They brought 3 generations of spiderman fans together in a way I don&#39;t see happening anytime soon until X-Men finds it&#39;s way",positive,positive
