3 years ago already?😢
Imagine if it was Bully maguire version of Tobey&#39;s(black suit) that was dragged into the verse.<br><br> It would have been diabolical!
3 years no Spider-man movie 🥹
Take me back 😢😢
Hey…
Here in 2024
"After 3 years, the trailer still creates the same feeling in me"
Who got this recommended?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=141"">2:21</a> This was always remain the best shot in the entire trailer cause it proved it all...we were right about them being in this"
I remember the hype in the tobey and andrew scene in the cinema
Anyone in 2024
"heriones from other universes know that peter is Spiderman, Why didn&#39;t they come back 😢"
"A I una cosa Jesús cristo los ama con amor Eterno y el viene pronto jeremías 31:3,Juan 3:16,revelaciones <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=1340"">22:20</a>🙌🏻🙏🏻❤️‍🔥🕊️"

I miss 2021 amazing movies
Anyone in 2024 ?
Hard to believe it’s been three years since the Lizard was punched by nothing.
3 years have passed and it feels like it was yesterday...
Time flies man.
Hello Peter
Its been 3 years time flies wheres spider man 4
i refuse to believe this was three years ago time is going too fast 😭
Remember when this trailer broke the internet?
I wanna time travel and see this movie in December again in theaters again and it became the best Spider-Man movie I ever saw in cinema history.
Aún sigue siendo emocionante
hollllyyyyy CRAP this is gonna be SO GOOD (im a frickin nerd)
3 years of no way home ❤
"3 year anniversary of this trailer, damn time sure does fly when your life is falling apart"
I imagine sonic 3 final trailer!!!!!
Spider-Man 3: Turning Point for a Better Marvel Cinematic Universe Reboot would show Norman Osborn/Green Goblin as the main villain looking 100% like the comics/1994 Animated Series just like Gwen Stacy would die. Also at the end of the movie Norman Osborn ends up in a Coma and Harry vows to get revenge on Spider-Man.
No way it&#39;s been 3 years already
3 years since this brilliant trailer
3 years have gone by and yet this feels like yesterday! 😢❤
3 years
Feels like yesterday 😭
Someone needs to stop time <br>Man
Wow 3 years ago today this trailer was released.
HAPPY 3 YEARS NO WAY HOME TRAILER!!!!
Happy 3th years Trailer!
MJ lowkey a baddie
Alguien?
3 Years
3 Years.....<br>I woke up at 3 AM just to watch this trailer 😭
This was the last marvel movie with real hype
WHO COOKED WITH THIS SOUNDTRACK
This movie created more hype than Endgame
"I haven&#39;t seen the movie and it&#39;s been two years since it was released, although I can tell the glove that catches mj is different from tom&#39;s so that is obviously andrew or toby and also the lizard got kicked in the face from nothing so they obviously tried removing them, and I peiced it together andrew cathes mj and kicks lizard, this took a whole day to figure out by comparing them and lightening the frame, and andrew is the only one that can move his back like that cus he isn&#39;t as old as toby, but nice try sony!"
Venom 4:New Reborn movie is officially releasing soon in 2026.
After 50 minutes ❤
All the Sony super hero movies are crucial for super heroes lovers
"Damn, got recommended after almost 3 yrs. I miss the hype"
Whos here after homecuming
Wait. Green Goblin and dock ock from Raimi verse is here?? I wish Tobey and Andrew will follow :(
Yo me uno<br><br><br><br><br>Jejej god
Best spiderman movie in history. Aged like wine.
"Christmas is coming next month, so I figured I’d buy this movie on Vudu as my Christmas present"
When Will This Materpiece Add On Disney+
eu adorei o homem aranha reagiu
Good😂
"how man, i miss you…"
Iconic 🥶
This movie was so good honestly because of the cameos and the old villains coming back
It&#39;s almost 3 years ago..
"It would have been a masterpiece if they added bully maguire, venom or Rhino"
Anyone in 2024???
Venom The Last Dance Is Out Now!
Marvel should have all rights to spider-man
Hype of Endgame ✅<br>Hype of No Way Home ✅ 🔥
2024🙋🙋🙋🙋
2024
This was such a good movie
bro marvel managed to hide the other spiderman
"Did anyone else forget Tobey and Andrew were NOT in the trailer while watching this, and then thought where are they?😂😂"
Gwen falling dont saved andrew<br>Zendaya falling saved andrew
Electro: You’re not gonna take this away from me<br><br>Electro was so much more awesome in this movie then he was in TAS2
This was such a great movie
Hello
I kinda wish Andrew Garfield refused this movie just to get back at them for doing him dirty with the Spider-Man franchise. They must’ve offered him a lot of money
"Just saw the TASM 2 Trailer Casually and realised NWH trailer and TASM 2 Trailer is so Similar, the theme the Bgm it&#39;s almost the same 🫡"

Absolute cinema
"Search up &quot;3 Dev Adam&quot;, would have been wild if they had incorporated that into this spider-verse as well😂"
Anyone here after Tony is casted after Dr doom😅
"you just had to be there, from the trailer release to the movie itself... you just had to be there, 3 generation of spider man, didyouknowhowlongwevewaitedforthis?"
Did this not come out in 2021
I believe Peter Parker brought Tony Stark as Evil Doom in the spark dimension in No way home and in the Next coming New Movie of spiderman will gives us spoiler for THE DOOM the movie.
My god the acting so cringe  tf
"Peter : Stephen, I need your help.<br>Dr. : you want me to cast a spell, so that everyone forget you are spidey .<br>Peter : Nope ,  cast a spell so that everyone forget what mysterio said.<br>Dr : Shit ....,   This boy is a genius."
It’s been 2 years 😢

"I just saw this movie for the first time and just because toby and andrew along with their villians see in it i loved it , although i thot the plot was awful and they should have made it more realistic and toby darker because toby doent play around , he will end you."
"Rewatching this, let’s be honest. We all thought Tom was gonna have a 1v3 moment"

استغفر الله
I cant believe it has been 2 years. Still feel the fresh vibes as 2 years ago. how quickly time flies but memories remain fresh
"I&#39;m so upset they got cured. Spiderman NEEDS Doc Oc, he NEEDS Green Goblin. Now, if they were to ever appear again, Peter will be just too aware of these people and their intentions. I wish it was a slow burn. I wish Doc Oc or Norman was in the first film as a good guy, maybe a different actor. Just so we could see how Peter reacts to these people he grew up with might change if he ISN&#39;T Spider-Man."
"Holy yeah, I still cannot believe ts film is real😭"

I miss the era 🥺
The hype this movie had though
2024
"Everytime a movie makes me both laugh and shed tears, it is considered a great one for me! This one did. I really like the part where the 3 spiderman characters are united and the subsequent parts, especially when they go find Peter who is mourning on top of tower and when they are in the lab together. The ending, starting let say with the part where Dr Strange tells Peter people will forget him to the moment Zendaya says to peter  &#39;&#39;I love you&#39;&#39; only with her lips from a distance touches me deeply every time I watch...This is my best movie from the Spiderman movie serie....Very entertaining!"

Who&#39;s here because they just wanted to watch this trailer without being annoyed by comments like this?
This was when the endgame hype came back
"(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=134"">2:14</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=141"">2:21</a>) 2 Years Man and I was in middle school when this happen bro like, I miss the biggest hype ever like these 2 parts made me hype as hell because it was such a good time to see the old villains of Spider-Man coming back especially sandman. Like literally after watching Deadpool &amp; Wolverine this was the best thing ever."

I miss this movie hype
what happened to the new goblin/goblin jr? he kind of just didn’t exist in this movie. or maybe it was because the green goblin was already the biggest threat?
I watch Spider man No way home in Netflix and It&#39;s a very great movie ❤❤😊
Future  generations  won&#39;t  understand  thr excitment this movie gave us
"I get the hype right now, didn’t now about the script🤯"
Deadpool &amp; Wolverine &gt;
Alguien en 2024?
😍😍😍
This movie is just perfect and I can&#39;t explain the hype in words and even after watching Deadpool and wolverine this much of feeling I didn&#39;t got . I also remembered that watching all empire movie pics breakdown trailer 1 2 breakdown videos in more than 20 channels for a complete day .... Just WOW yeah definitely upcoming movies will have the same level of hype but this movie&#39;s hype is more special next to endgame
2024 anyone?
Anyone watching this after it was announced Robert Downey Jr. is Dr. Doom?
Goblin voice ❤️

There is tobey and andrew in this movie
"watching this in 2024 and realizing this is what marvel was, this is the marvel we lost"
Who else got recommended by this again ?
ฉันผิดหวังกับภาคนี้ โทบี้กับแอนดรูว์ออกตอนท้ายๆ แล้วโทบี้เป็นสไปเดอร์แมน3 หนังเค้าออกมาก่อนหนังเค้าทำออกมาคือชอบทั้งโทบี้และแอนดรูว์บทไม่เด่นเลยอย่าเอามารวมกันอีก<br>พวกคุณเอาสไปเดอร์แมนมาโดนแทง<br>แฟนหนังรับไม่ได้
I&#39;m curious what kind of movie we would&#39;ve gotten if Sony didn&#39;t work out a new deal with Disney. My guess Venom vs Spider-Man.
I hate Zendaya
After Endgame No Way Home is One of the greatest marvel movie
Almost 3 years later and I still remember the hype for this film it was like nothing I’d ever seen and to be someone who experienced it the 2nd night it was out was amazing I’ll never forget that 2 hours and 30 minutes with my father
Went to go see it on my birthday (2 years ago) and me and my girl had the whole theater to ourselves the movie definitely didn’t disappoint and lived up to my expectations 🔥💯
Now I get it hype on 60´s for Star Wars...

The casting director confused Flash Thompson as Gru. Hence the choice of actor.
Goosebumps
Wish this would come to Disney + like the other Spider-Man&#39;s. I wanna see this movie.
"Might be corny but, this movie really helped me heal. I was deployed to the Middle East in 2021 for 7 months and I was depressed as hell cause my then gf cheated on me before and while I was gone. I remember only looking forward to the marvel, dc and star wars shows and movies , waiting for them to come out. <br><br>This movie being the biggest thing ever at the time for me. I remember loving every bit of it! It was all I ever wanted and expected and more! <br><br>From Matt Murdock to Eddie Brock showing up, MJ being saved by Andrew, Doc Ock coming back it was just, oh man I can’t even explain how happy I was"
Still watching this trailer in 2024 because this is one of my favorite
MJ: <b>*falls*</b><br>Tom: <b>Jumps</b><br>Andrew: <b>Jumps</b><br>Tobey: &quot;I missed the part where that&#39;s my problem&quot;
We are in the layers
Kon kon 2024 me aaya hai like here❤❤❤
❤❤❤
"Only one peter parker is here haa,, marvel @ sony making us fool 😅😅"
Hey guys wait wait I just realise in trollhunters the rise of Titans Toby dies and Jim reverse the time the same happens in Spider-Man no way home Doctor Strange reverse the time😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
i thought his black and gold suit was the symbiote 😭
"The Hype For Spider Man No Way Home Was Insane, No Movie Will Compare To This One."
Is it me or did when i watch the trailer you all think the black suit was the symbiote suit
"who is watching this on 2024, 7th of july"
IT&#39;S GRATIFYING AS A YOUNG WOMAN TO SEE TALENTED YOUNG WOMEN WITH ORDINARY BEAUTY PARTICIPATING IN MORE AND MORE FILMS.
Still remember when this movie really make alot people hyped
Haven&#39;t seen this yet just bits and pieces..it seems very good..but most marvel comic movies are..
horseshit
This is the truly &quot;u had to be there&quot;
Can somebody explain me if all the people who knew Peter Parker is spider man got alive in other multiverse and they saved those persons why Gwen didn’t spawn there she also knew that peter is spider man
The rumours of this movie thwt Tobey and Andrew are gonna be in this we’re insane <br>I wish I could go back
Nicholas Hammond as the original Spiderman should have been in this.
In the movie he says shit😂😂😂
I was so afraid that i would get a spoiler. I didn&#39;t even watch this trailer. This is the first time i am watching it.
Who has come here after 2 years of this movie 🎥 release.<br> 👇
I still can&#39;t Forget how hype I was when this movie was realised.
"I think No Way Home would have been so much better if Spider-man had faced Kraven The Hunter. I always felt that Kraven was the most lethal opponent of Spider-man&#39;s, he was the evil version of Wolverine, minus the mysterious past. Don&#39;t get me wrong, No Way Home was still good with Toby and Andrew and all of the villians they fought in their movies, but it seemed like Tom Holland&#39;s Spider-man was fighting hand me downs from his two older brothers instead of a different villian. Yes it was fun to watch all three Spider-men together, but too much like older brothers watching over and helping out their younger brother."
Who’s here July 2024
The end of Spider-Man ???
When another Spider Man movie comes out I want the final battle to be all 3 actors of Spider Man Vs Venom &amp; Carnage
Whole trailer one side and Green Goblin line on another
This movie was so big 2 years ago EVERYONE was hyped future generations will never understand that
Those who are watching in 2024...🎉❤
2024 time is going so fast ⚡
This was the movie that finally sold me on Tom Holland as Spider-man. I didn&#39;t like his other solo films... Hopefully his new trilogy is great
Rompio internet esto en su momento
I was so fucking hype 2 years ago man<br>Time flies
I love my son…❤
"Andrew deserves justice , he need Amazing spider 3 ASAP"
2024 ?
before the movie was released in the theater i watched this official trailer and i really thought tom holland peter parker is gonna 1v5 all the enemies and thought andrew garfield and tobey maguire doesnt appear
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=121"">2:01</a> “the perfect transition doesn’t exist”"
I can’t believe it’s been 2 and a half year since this movie released feels like yesterday
Were all getting old
This was 2 years ago
Will Doctor Strange appear in the movie??? 😱
The last best MCU movie
"Moments &quot;Peter&#39;s friends&quot; are true SHIT<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=148"">2:28</a> LET HER DIEEEE!"
Who&#39;s here in 2024?
Spider Man Monday has been the highlight of the summer box office.
At least give us 10 min footage each of Toby&#39;s Spiderman Universe and Andrew&#39;s Spiderman Universe as to what happened in the aftermath of No way home in their universe <br>How they are living and give Andrew his MJ
"Very BAD,the worst spiderman movie ever made.shame on the expense..."
Make tasm 3
Spider-Man No Way Home is my all-time favorite spiderman live-action flim with my 2 best stars Tom Holland and Zendaya My Number 1 Favorite and Best Flim of the Year 2021.
They copied this multiverse idea from into the spider verse
Time runs so fast it feels like yesterday
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=127"">2:07</a> Before the movie came out, I used to think Spider-Man was falling into the multiverse and Doctor Strange tried to &quot;save&quot; him."
Very nice 👌
The suspense
cant wait for this 😍
"Yes, it&#39;s fan service, but after more than 20 years, we&#39;ve earned it.   And this movie delivered everything we wanted, and so much more.  Spider-Man done so right!  Now, on to the next trilogy--wherein Peter goes to College and begins to rebuild his life!"
Ah yes.. youth.. never satisfied
I dont have everything I want.. I am actually satisfied with my needs...
the line
I had to tell you
Anyone here in 2024

"Watching in 2024 , just Same vibs  🔥"

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=155"">2:35</a> <br>Ever since I saw this trailer for the first time every cell in my body just screamed this was 20 years in the making with that piece of music thinking about the first time I saw Tobey’s Spider-Man back in  theaters in 2002 to witnessing where we came to now"

The last good live-action Marvel movie.
Silly fool spiderman
This was truly amazing.

Genz isnt gonna understand how powerful hype this movie brought...the team...the enemies....and all three spider mans
"I literally cried watching this movie at 2 instances, first when Tobey entered via portal &amp; second when Andrew&#39;s Peter got his redemption after saving MJ. ❤"
Team prefer to watching training to watching full movie
kendimi 2021&#39;e fragmanları heyecanla beklediğim günlerde gibi hissettim
Scoobi do says alot flashing back great animations🎉🎉
The hype for this movie was genuinely so crazy
THANK YOU SPIDER-MAN. YOU SAVED DEADPOOL FROM MEETING DEADPOOL IRL. Thank you so much ant-man we love marvel bejesus. Much love Doodle Deadpool. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>P.S. (Wolverine dies again)<br>Spoiler Alert. Whoops.
three years from a post credit scene and now everyone forgot this movie
The real crossover wasn’t in the movie. Wong vs The Beyonder from the 90s animated Spider-Man. On Fox Kids and Jet-X for the young fuckers.
YouTube recommended me this trailer today .<br>What a hopeful movie it was...!! ❤
I’m gonna make my kids Hardcore Spider-Man Fans n will make em wait for years to watch it in the same sequence they were released in. ❤
I MISS THIS MOVIE SO MUCH❤
"Watched the movie, still here 😂😂"
03.04.2024😢❤
2024?
one of my best movies 🙏
hello😊
.
Crazy this trailer really spoiled almost everything
❤❤❤
I want this time back
Brilliant marketing. We never knew the other Spidermen were gonna be in this movie! Up until the DAY IT CAME OUT!<br><br>Very impressively done.
i just watch ts sometimes to feel something
"This was literally avengers:endgame, PURE CINEMA😝😩"
Nostalgia bait movie and y&#39;all ate it
last movie i enjoyed watching in theater and time really files by
"The movie gave me what I always wanted as a kid, all the Spider-Men coming together in the end."
this trailer still give me goosebumps 2024
My kids won’t understand the hype that was around this trailer
Who is see this in 2024  😅
the new generation won&#39;t ever get how excited you were to see all three spidermans in 1 movie for nearly 3 hours i wish i could see it for the first time again now i just live a miserabel life and probably will for the rest of my life enjoy highschool because life is gonna go heck lower than that after you graduate my biggest wish was to be happy again i haven&#39;t laughed and smiled like that since i left with my buddies for nearly 2 years ago you would think you&#39;d be happy once you left but after you would wish every single day that you could go back and laugh and run around with ur buddies 1 last time peace out i hope you get better the person reading this there will be light at the bottom of the tunnel maybe not for me
Still gives me chills everytime I watch it even after 2 years
We also of course need madame&#39;s web
Still one of the best nights I had in cinema
Spider-Man 👑
I like Spider-Man
мынау мейрамбек беспаев қой ебаааа
Waiting for 4
2024?
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=138"">2:18</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=141"">2:21</a> They literally chopped out andrew and tobey from their scenes in the trailer to not give spoilers 😂😂"
Gosh I wish I can go back in time and experience this again in THEATERS 😭
I&#39;m not feeling old you&#39;re feeling old
"Kids nowadays can never understand how much hype this had. Like everyday we were getting theories... Damn, I kinda miss those days"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=111"">1:51</a> ❤"
I don&#39;t remember this trailer. Maybe it was when I decided I didn&#39;t want to risk any more spoilers that I stopped watching trailers and stories?
With great superpower great responsibility come<br><br>-Aunt may and uncle ben
The last good marvel movie
Anyone in 2024 just reminiscing about better times??
sony really makes the worst trailers
Spiderman 1: homecoming<br>Spiderman 2: far from home<br>Spiderman 3: no way home<br>Spiderman 20: home alone<br>Spiderman 50: heaven is my home
Movie was fire. This trailer was epic
It&#39;s happens 3 years ago 😢
Only Marvel fans knows that this movie hype is greater than endgame..
7 April 2024 saw thi❤
Came back for the comments
Who remembers that the Portuguese version of the Trailer lasted one second more and we could see the Lizard getting an invisible kick?
There will never be another spiderman movie as great as this one.
Avoided to use internet for 2 days to see the movie without a spoiler suck a hype ! ❤
Chilllllzzzzzzzzzzzz I love this movie
👍👍👍
A trailer with zero spoiler
Phim như c hay vl
I wonder why Harry Osborn from the Raimiverse isn&#39;t in here...he died knowing Parker was Spider-Man
"I wish we were getting Spider-Man 4 this year, but we’re not gonna get any Spider-Man movies this year anyway which sucks💀💀💀😭"
Imagine if Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man make an appearance it would make it such a great movie
"you are not peter,the future generations cant understand"
Can’t believe it’s been 2 years 😢
The last good mcu movie…
i cant want for avengers secret wars...
Am i the only one who came back here...just to realise... how much hype it really gave us!!!
"Boa noite, vim aqui dizer que só o amor de Deus pode preencher nosso vazio. Só falem com Ele"
This was literally the LAST good thing Marvel did.
"Don&#39;t expect much, but it&#39;s worth watching. Although it is nice to gather the actors together, there is still not the desired excitement. There are many missing parts. Still watchable....If you watch Marvel in Chronological form, you will understand it better. Let me show you in a list.....<br>Captain America: The First Avenger<br>Captain Marvel <br>Iron Man<br>The Incredible Hulk<br>Iron Man 2<br>Thor<br>avengers<br>Thor: The Dark World<br>Iron Man 3<br>Captain America: The Winter Soldier<br>Guardians of the Galaxy<br>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2<br>Avengers: Age of Ultron<br>Ant-Man<br>Captain America: Civil War<br>Black Panther<br>Spider-Man: Homecoming<br>Black Widow<br>Doctor Strange<br>Thor: Ragnarok<br>Ant-Man and the Wasp<br>Avengers: Infinity War<br>Avengers: Endgame<br>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings<br>Spider-Man: Far From Home<br>Eternals<br>Spider-Man: No Way Home<br>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness<br>Thor: Love and Thunder<br>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever<br>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania<br>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3<br>The Marvels...."
Still can’t believe this movie even happened all 3 best spider man’s together 😂😂😂😂😭
türk var mı ben varım da 😂
"no way, it&#39;s home"
The hype of this film was insane
"I never getting bored wathing this trailer, the soundtracks so satisfying, love this part <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=90"">1:30</a>"
Ah man! I got some serious nostalgia while watching this trailer again🎉
Man this is one of the greatest trailers
I hope future peter meet ursula and maried
It was best movie after endgame
From all this time I watched this trailer I learned every part of what they said
Mary Jane? Looks more like Mariangela to me
"Ya’ll remember when Andrews kick against the Lizard was leaked in the Brazilian version, and everyone was going crazy over the fact that we were getting all of Spider-men🥹🤧"
2021 felt like yesterday
Did anybody notice the glitch on the part that after may died and both Peter&#39;s going to his school roof top to support him the moment after they jumped and landed you can see the fake placement
"It&#39;s 2024, I still miss this kind of Marvel hype era bruh"
Bro i am watching this trailer after movie and there was no clue for all three spiderman in the movie
Watching this on netflix right now and i came to say this movie is utter nonsense it mentions brainwashing thats funny becuase its exactly what this movie was made to do.... Brainwash everyone its nonsense.
The final good marvel movie
"I remember going to see it the night it came out. I went to school the next day and threatened my class with spoilers…suffice to say, they didn’t act up!"
I havent seen this yet
"Hi, I&#39;m spanish speaker. Somebody can tell me because Strange say &quot;So Scooby-doo this crap&quot;? Which is the context of the sentences? I know that Scooby-doo is a cartoon 😅😅😅"
"In retrospect no way home has a lot of flaws,, but it’s undeniable just how fun, heartfelt, and hype experiencing this movie was"
Watching this on 2024🔥
"Why do I feel this spiderman is sort of annoying creature, stubborn sort of childish unmature unwise talkative? Or may be I just adore Doctor Strange too way much."
😢😮😮😮
☝️
Insane to see what so many franchises became in 2 years...nobody is interested in MCU anymore.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=96"">1:36</a>"
I was sobbing when Mj fell I kept looking her up to see if she was booked after this cause I HAD NO CLUE GWEN WAS GONNA 😢
Lmao so many edited scenes in this trailer☠️☠️☠️....the producers really tried ayy
I have never seen a movie that made me feel so many emotions
2024❤❤
The joy and emotion I felt throughout this movie and where I was is special to me. Everything felt right within a moment. I appreciate this art.
Is 2 years
Wow it&#39;s been 3 years huh ?
WTF ITS BEEN 2 YEARS ALREADY WHAT I JUST REMEMBER SEEING THE MOVIE AND THING
ayoo tobey and andrew werent in the trailerr!!
Andrew Garfield ❤
The.  I.  I want that movie called Disney+ the Spider-Man movie no way home please
Gotta admire how they made Strange say &quot;They all die fighting Spiderman.&quot; Only for it to be Sandman who says that
Dkf
Who is here in 2024. And feel nostalgia.
This was the last great Marvel movie.
Lets gooo
The hype this movie had📈📈📈📈…i remember my friends and i went in for the very first show in the morning in the very day of release
Best moment ever🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
2 years wow 😮
Already over 2 years ago… damn
I just watched this and i got so emotional because of the hype 😭<br>I&#39;m glad it happened 😁
🎉🎉🎉❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
2024 ???
shout out to the editing guy from Sony Brazil who fucked up the CGI and shows Lizard getting kicked mid air by something invisible 😅😅😭
"I remember watching this movie for the first time in the theaters. I was alone but I wasn’t lonely. Found myself highfiving and cheering with everyone around my seat. It was just tears and happiness, man!"
It was alright.
THIS MOVIE IS TWO YEARS OLD
Obsessed I grew up with all spiderman
Some people didn’t Experience this on day 1 release with the cinema being hyped to see tobey and Andrew
Fun fact — <br>You are not here first time.
"I watched this movie 10 times, But now I want to watch New Home instead of watching No Way Home for so long"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=115"">1:55</a> &quot;You&#39;ll never take this away from me&quot; ⚡😤💪🏼"
The fact that this is turning 3 years old this year is honestly crazy
SPOILER ALERT!!!⚠️.<br><br><br><br>Why did they kill Aunt May in this movie. And why didn&#39;t peter call MJ to push the button on the cube before it was too late 😢
Awesome film
"@ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=72"">1:12</a> it makes me laugh so much how bad the cuts are 😭😭😭every time"
❤❤ 1/29/24
so what happens when this peter meets his universe&#39;s otto octavious?
everyone remembers where they were...
How has it been 2 years already?!!! 😳
Can&#39;t believe this was 2 years ago....still remember it like it was yesterday....
It&#39;s by far the best trailer that I have watched to date. And I keep coming back to watch it.
"Rewatching this trailer gives me a special feeling. Remembering how excited I was for this movie and the hype that surrounded it. Man, I haven&#39;t felt that in a while."
One of the greatest Spider-Man movies the fans has ever received 🕷️
miss the moment
3 years old and a Classic.
The last great MCU film. We will never get another like this.
"I didn’t want to go watch it alone, so after three weeks and several damn spoilers, I decided to watch it on my phone(didn’t looks great, but still watchable)…once the movie ended I cried and I honestly can’t tell you if they were tears of joy or tears of finally watching it, I remember begging my dad to take me to see maguire Spider-Man when I was in elementary…I was a good boy for sometime until it released…it’s just just so good, dare I say that I personally loved this more than infinity war and endgame"
.
Such a good movie
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=120"">2:00</a>"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=154"">2:34</a> music 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
This trailer came out on 11/16 back in 2021. The movie dropped in December and this was the only like legit footage we had for it. God dam the marketing for this was weird.
"I just saw this movie, and for fvcks sake.<br>This version of spider is the most r3tarded, and care free &quot;superhero&quot; I&#39;ve seen.<br>I grew up with Tobey Maguire and the differences between both are out of this world.<br><br>Not only did he jeopardize the lives of everyone because he didn&#39;t make it to college, but then he went around Dr. Strange&#39;s advise because &quot; he felt he could help them&quot; avoid death with no regards for the consequences of doing so.<br><br>Can we get a real Spider-Man?"
hello
i’ll never forget seeing this in theatres ugh
2018: Avengers infinity war <br>2019: Avengers endgame<br>2021: spider man no way home<br>These movies was time to be alive for superhero fans missing those days now 😭😭😭🥲🥲
wow
"If you want more hype, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” makes its network television premiere on January 16th at 7 PM on FX!"

Hello Peter
2024 anyone ?? 😮‍💨
The last great mcu movie.
I would give anything to experience the unreal hype for this movie again. Can&#39;t believe this came out two years ago.
🕷🕸️
"Watching the trailer after watching the movie made me feel pain since doctor strange said crap instead of shit, maybe because of youtube"
"&quot;Yeah so just have Jamie Foxx, as Electro, say nothing of value. Tell him to be upset that Peter Parker isn&#39;t black&quot;"
Who&#39;s here on new years day?<br>👇
Better than Endgame🔥
Whos here on 1st January 2024?
Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 2 years...
2 years later still the greatest movie ever.
I would love for MARVEL to create a movie based on the original spider-woman/ Jessica Drew and she meet Peter Parker! I love all of the spider-man movies and can&#39;t to see what Peter Parker gets up to next. Thank you for your time to read this xxx ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m buggin or sum I thought this movie came out in 2022
"That December,my godd..i have watched this no. Of timess but still ❤❤end of movie,will bring you cry"
"😂 Marvel Studios ? But surely No Hollywoodcamera !!! Nasty unsharp Backgrounds , 👎🎥, IS IT forcing eyesickness ??? This ain&#39;t No Quality ! I do ASK a question: the movies camerauser ,If He IS with His car ON His Gasstation , will He agree that only His half carwindow gets cleaned or will He Desire that the carwindows have to get completely cleaned because He wants to have a clear sight ? But for the moviewatshers He switsh the cameraeffect unsharp active ? Sabotage? Nasty service Bad Quality ! Movie destroyed !"
No Way Home &amp; Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3 are the last good Marvel movies.
Time flies
Very good movie
The ending of the trailer had is all HYPE!!
I would do anything to go back and watch this movie with my friends
Quisiera volver a esos tiempos
Ya 2 años que se cumplió el sueño de varios (me incluyo) ninguna otra pelicula de marvel logrará el hype autentico que nos dio esta pelicula (quiza deadpool 2)
Best cinema movie experience for me ever

MASTERPIECE ( MCU + SPIDERMAN = 1000/10 )
I miss this era
It&#39;s weird that he says &quot;ever since I got bit by that spider&quot; which we never saw in the MCU.
Most overrated movie ever.
The hootings in the halls begins
"Love the move. absolutely fantastic.<br>Destroying Stan Lee&#39;s concept of superheroes, implementing future black spider man as a subconscious pretext, life goes on, people are changing, more indoctrination, no more mass manipulation, love it. <br>Subliminal messages love it. I need to be part of this movement 😊"
Legend komic
Best marvel phase 4 flim
Time goes....
Here after the movie completed its 2 years anniversary. Time flies...
You are not peter parker<br>Sold me
TWO YEARS AGO IS INSANE
Happy 2 years!
Movie name ??

Happy 2 year
"damn its been 2 YEARS since this came out, it feels like it was yesterday i watched this for the first time"
It’s been 2 years……
Tom is not good for actor<br>Tobey is very nice then tom
"I come back after 2 years and it was so awesome i remember back in 2021 when the trailer just came out I was so hype, thank you so much"
2 years later... 🎉
"2 роки пройшло з моменту виходу фільму. Пам&#39;ятаю як в ці дні всі лише і говорили про те, чи будуть у фільмі Паучки з інших всесвітів,, але все ж таки, вони були і фільм вийшов just Amazing"
On this day 2 years ago we witnessed a masterpiece

I wish i had a time machine 🫠
"2 years ago, my Christmas break started, I failed my math exams, and I immediately went to go watch this with my best friend. Best day of my life."
I miss that feeling
This Movie Will Be 2 Years Old Tomorrow <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Time Files Man....
2 years to this incredible movie. <br>I still remember I was so excited going to the theatre to watch the movie on 16th Dec 2021 in India. <br>This movie also helped me meet my best friend for the first time after 1½ years of lockdown. Oh the hype was real man. I remember waking up on 17th November 2021 at 6 or 7 am to watch the 2nd trailer and it got around 3M views in 2 minutes... <br>The hype was so real. I wanna relive 17 Nov 2021 and 16 Dec 2021 so bad. 😭❤️‍🔥
"It&#39;s been 2 years... ❤, even today also i can feel the hype which it had at that time."
Dois anos atrás.
The multiverse Is real
"God, I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 2 years, I used to read the leaks every day and get excited, now no movie excites me and I miss 2021 so much."
This movie is so good
today marks the day when this movie became 2 years old 😔

"It&#39;s been 2 years since the trailer was released, and I remember trying not to fall asleep at night so as not to miss it and woke up at about 6 a.m. and watched it."
Crap
"Aquí todos los latinos que después de casi dos años del estreno de esta joya, volvemos a ver este jodido tráiler y nos sigue emocionando bien kbron. ♥️"
Я автобот оптімус скайуокер
This era in my life will never be topped
Trailer STILL gives me chills
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=148"">2:28</a>"
"You know, I watched this movie on the Thursday night screening before the “release day” and I never watched this trailer until today, two years after I saw the movie. Damn it was hype, but I’m glad I didn’t watch it, this trailer spoils too much😭"
"The popularity veiws were in the brazillions,its a fact and a pun"
"I come to remember, I will never forget this movie, it was beautiful to live that Spider Verse experience in December. ❤"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) <br>Director: Jon Watts <br>Filming Dates: October 14, 2020 - March 26, 2021 <br>Release Date: December 17, 2021 <br>MPAA Rating: PG-13 [Parents Strongly Cautioned] <br>Runtime: 2 hr 28 min (148 min)"
the hype for this movie was actually insane
2 Years Ago Dam

Can&#39;t believe this movie is real it&#39;s literally too good to be true
Mid
"Nobody believed this dude would try to take on 3 former spider super villains himself, I for sure knew it was the perfect strat for them to all come together as spidermen in this movie."
Yo me vi esa película con mi madre y hermanos ❤
2 years passed without a spidey film
Andrew Garfield was across the street at the Paris Theater in NYC promoting Tic Tic Boom when this trailer dropped.
2 years is wild
You don’t need to have powers to be a superhero <br>you just need to be a good person
it&#39;s being 2 years and i still enjoyed it😅❤
Next movie must be &#39;Spider-Man Homeless&#39;😂😂😂😂
"The ability of the Spider-Man films to portray Peter Parker&#39;s dual life—that of an apparently normal teenager juggling the extraordinary responsibilities of being a superhero—is one of their most notable features. The struggle to strike a balance between one&#39;s personal life and one&#39;s responsibilities as a crime-fighting vigilante, whether played by Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, or Tom Holland, is a recurring theme in the films. Because it captures the universal struggle of juggling conflicting facets of one&#39;s life, this theme appeals to audiences.Filmmakers can now vividly depict Spider-Man&#39;s web-slinging stunts and fights against strong adversaries thanks to advancements in visual effects. Movies featuring superhero action sequences that go beyond swinging through New York City skyscrapers and taking on legendary villains like Venom, Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, and the Vulture have set a higher standard.Furthermore, what sets Spider-Man movies apart is how moral quandaries and the human side of superheroes are portrayed. Audiences are deeply impacted by Peter Parker&#39;s internal struggles, his desire to do good, and the sacrifices he makes for the greater good. In conclusion, by fusing exciting action, gripping narrative, and likable characters, Spider-Man films have irrevocably altered the film industry. These movies, which feature everyone&#39;s favorite amiable neighborhood superhero, never fail to enthrall audiences, whether they&#39;re swinging across cityscapes or navigating life&#39;s challenges."
I don&#39;t really like every new Spider-Man that comes Now you really compare Toby&#39;s and Andrew&#39;s Spider-Man with this generation&#39;s Spider-Man
This was the greatest experience
"Best movie ever! This is the greatest MCU film of all time in my opinion besides Black Panther, Endgame, and Guardians of the Galaxy."
Anyone watching in 2023?
NOTHING will top the hype of this movie not even Avengers
NWH hype &gt;
I literally woke up in the midle of the night to watch the trailer 😂
"I’m here, exactly 2 years after this trailer released ( 18th December 2023) and I’m still having goosebumps watching this and writing this comment! This was the best ever thing! 😭😭😭 that hype was real!! Something else"
"In hindsight, its CRAZY how much they spoil in this trailer..."
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩💖
2 YRS!!!!
Sempre vou ser grato por ter nascido pra ver esse filme acontecer
My favorite movie ❤
2 years ago we got this amazing movie🥹🫶🏾
Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s 2 years now
2 years....
"Damn, 2 years now?"
I can’t believe it’s been over 2 years since this master piece of trailer dropped. I am grateful 🥹 for being able to experience this
2 years after this trailer... Feels like yesterday
Ya 2 Años Que Rapido Pasa el tiempo❤
I have no idea why but after 2 years i am back here 😂
Exactly Two years since this trailer released
I remember waiting for this trailer the whole day and i woke up so early to watch this trailer<br>damn..
I&#39;m so excited for this movie 😍 I think tobey maguire is ganna be in no way home 👀
Still feels surreal
Man I’d love to time slip to my theatre of December 17
2 years...
As of today it&#39;s been officially 2 years since this amazing trailer has been shown. I say this is the 2nd best marvel trailer of all time after Avengers: Infinity Wars. Oh how I wish I can go back to 2021 and relive the hype again.
Here I am at 2 year at that trailer
2 years
"Wow 2 years ago,time flies man.I remember being so hyped for this movie"
2 years already
good
"two years, wow"
2yrs for this 💥💥🤌🤌🤌
Two years ago today was when I felt the ultimate hype for this movie
TWO YEARSSSS
2 años de tremendas pajas mentales que la mayoría fueron acertadas
"2 años después ;), quisiera volver a esa época"
This trailer released 2 years ago today. Man the hype feom the trailer was awesome.
Two years later and I still get fucking chills
Happy 2 year anniversary
Happy 2 years!!!!!
HAPPY 2 YEARS!!!
Wow this was two years ago. Crazy how fast time is
2 years of this trailer! Gosh it felt like yesterday we were so hyped about it LMAO. Time really flies :)
I understand why people disliked Tom Hollands Spidey Trilogy I’m also one of those people who had trouble with it cause in the MCU Peter was like a puppy under Tony’s feet all the time but his character development in this film finally got rid of it and even if Tobey or Andrew weren’t in the film it still would’ve been good and gave him the character development he needed.
I miss the hype it was GENERATIONAL
2 years passed of this trailer... wow...
Love the movie so good
Bro idk how I knew this trailer came out 2 years ago. Woke up and I was like wasn’t the no way trailer dropped today in 2021. Crazyyy….. 😂😂😂😂
One year later and this stills giving me chills
I Am Missing The Incredible Hype Of This Movie 👑👑
i want this movie once again in theaters
Bro I cannot wait for this to come out next month
Wow😍😍😍
Man I just re-watched this and found it even more awesome then in theaters it was so epic man Nothing compared to the hype
This Movie Just Makes Me Appreciate The Sam Raimi Trilogy Even More And More!
Zendaya is so god damn annoying.
Mary Jane is wrong  and what is that stupid Chinese or hawiian boy is ..why act and look so stupid ...and not spiderman more like spiderboy
Aunt May&#39;s death and Tom Holland weeps: 😪😴<br>A tough moment as Tom Holland bids farewell to his girlfriend and best friend: 😪😴<br>The returns of the villains: 😱😱<br>The Spiderman returns of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield: 🥺🥺😭😭
Lool black MJ is disgusting
"This movie is a masterpiece, I love it so much. Nothing will ever compare to the No way home movie theatre experience, I’ll never forget it. I love all the spider man movies so much. This movie is so special to me since I grew up with the Raimi spider man’s and I have seen all the movies and I love them all. Spider man will always be my favourite super hero"
Will never get over hearing Goblins voice and just chills!!!!
this trailer still give me goosebumps even after a year of the movie out
Will go down as one of the most iconic movies of all time
This movie is something else! Insane.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=74"">1:14</a>"
The beginning is boooring
What soundtrack is?
AS salaam 👁🔥👁
AL Jabbar 👁🔥👁
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=99"">1:39</a>"
S&#39;il vous plaît faites The Amazing Spider-Man 3 🥺🙏
people really watch this shit? this looks terrible
I remember watching this with my friends at the cinema… what a day to remember
Over one year so fast. Spider man Should return.
"I remember the hype for this SOOO much, I remember watching this trailer over and over"
The editing in hiding Tobey and Andrew was SPECTACULAR
I miss the hype for this movie so much 😭
Man the no way home era was an elite time seriously never before have I ever seen so much hype for a movie. Also living in the UK we never cheer in our cinemas not even for endgame but for this we all went crazy
"I just wish I could experience it for the first time again. I&#39;m gonna watch this trailer, when I grow old and remember how hyped we all were for this movie."
I really hope they make another one❤️
Will always cry for not being able to experience this movie again for the 1st time😭😭
What an experience i had with this movie!!!
It’s crazy how i completely missed hearing about this movie.  I wonder why they didn’t do a better job at marketing it and hyping it up
It all went downhill from here
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=90"">1:30</a> this trailer goes from being fine to being epic"
God i hated and loved this movie 😭
"Seeing this in theatres was an experience. This trailer was hype, but the film itself surpassed it by leaps and bounds."
I just watched this movie and was completely unprepared of three spidermans and bad guys from the past. Didn&#39;t watched a trailer and nobody told me about. 😅just blew my mind. I couldn&#39;t believe it.. All three in one movie 😅amazing.. Just amazing. 🙏🏽👍🏼😊👏🏼well done.
This is the second best mcu movie behind Avengers: Endgame
This was the shit man I miss the hype
Leo movie trailer hits 3M likes just 7 days
"It&#39;s nearly 2024, can&#39;t understand how the time flies... I wish that hype from these times to come back again and to watch the movie for the first time."
This movie&#39;s hype will always be next to Endgame
This was the most depressing spiderman movie ever.  I wish it had never been made.
I just wanna live my total life in the hype of this movie ❤
"Is it me or did anyone see other spideys in this trailer???, 🤔🤔"
I didn&#39;t watch the movie the reason was Toby maguire has been the main character from the first 3 movies and my opinion he would still make a great spider man
Trash movie made for kids.
There&#39;s never gonna be another infinty war craze <br><br>And then they drop this heat.
I mean it’s 2023 nearly 2024 and let’s be honest this has to be one of the best trailers ever made
After 2 years anyone watching this trialer? This trailer still getting goosebumps 🤯🤩
No way home was a 9/10 movie  i think tobey and andrew could had moree scenes
this movie cemented my dislike to the Peter Parker that Tom Holland portraits and the MJ in the same universe.<br>I personally prefer the portrayals of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire.
I wanna experience this in theatres AGAAAAAIIIINNNN
"DREAMing of these comic books, my favorite Comic Book store is Secret Headquarters it makes me yelp"
A year later and I just realized that the Far from home trailer got more views than this one
Take me back in timeeeee
Thank you for this movie. Thank you for the message. It helped me be more aware of enemies as well as heroes and you GOD. Thank you that you’re always speaking. Nothing was made that was not made by you. ❤❤❤
Andrew Garfield entry and future generations kids be like: why this people yelling at him
Will always remember this feeling
This movie came out almost 2 years ago wth
In my early 20 I watch Tobey M as spiderman i the cinema and know 20 years later.....this.<br>Can&#39;t belive I just learn about this movie now 😮😮😮.  <br>Its amazing.
"To think we all went insane in 2016, when the silver war trailer came out and we saw Spider-Man at the end. Who would’ve thought a couple years later we would see all three of them  together."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=94"">1:34</a> spider-man in a scandinavian forest looks so illegal to see"
"My spiderman movie. Everything was perfect, characters, story, action scenes, villians and realize date. Made my 2021 ending memorable."
He said he got bit by a spider then how come he makes his own web fluid this is so confusing me.
almost 2 years. this hits harder in 2023
After almost 2 years i still got massive chills from this trailer
This movie made 2021
pls movei
This one gets way more than 5 stars!!
Too bad Venom is just a cameo on this movie 😢
This movie was so hype
"If I could go back and relive this experience again, I would. One of the most pinnacle moments of my life. Glad I lived to see it.<br><br><br><br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=130"">2:10</a> I&#39;m also now just realising that you can hear the sound of Andrew Garfield&#39;s web shooter going off... how did we all miss that? 💀"
............
"Хоч пройшло багато часу з моменту коли трейлер вийшов, коли всі ми його чекали, але навіть зараз під час перегляду йдуть мурашки по тілу"
"Youre not Peter Parker , that masterpiece moment"
almost 2 years is crazy🙏😭
"One of the three best MCU movies in Phase 4 and 5 in my opinion<br>Vol 3, No way home and Wakanda forever"
"I remember watching this movie with my girlfriend and now she&#39;s already with someone else. I really miss her and the tickets of this movie, I still have it and kept it."
Only we guys know how much  hype this movie created
One of the most overrated comic book films of the year.
"Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man in every Universe . Let’s go, I loved the movie"
2021 Was an incredible Year for movies. Hype was insane back then.
🙏🏽🛐🛌⭕️🏄‍♀️💭💧⏳🫀🕸🏃‍♀️🪶📈🐕🐅🌙♾🐈‍⬛⚖️🌑🤲🏽🐞🐨🌞✨⌛️❄️🌈💯🌧🛐🙏🏽
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=141"">2:21</a> the fact that they didn&#39;t show Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield is amazing"
Best cinema experience ever
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Marvel Entertainment Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment
"This is the worst episode ever. This is crap. I had big hopes about this part of Spiderman, but this is crap. Flat boring story, etc.."
Dont get me started on Doctor Strange and the little nerd back on earth 1999999
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=119"">1:59</a>"
OK.
Awesome 👍.
Great.
Great
I can&#39;t it&#39;ll be almost 2 years 😫
Time really files.
"Watching this for the first time was amazing, i loved the ending and every moment of it, 10/10 masterpiece right here!"
WOW
Tom🐐&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tobey ans Andrew
Tom Holland is the best Spider-man
Best hype movie ever
This was the worst Spider-Man movie ever made.
"Most of Spider-Man’s enemies are not evil like Sandman he was just doing that for his daughter and if his daughter was ok then Sandman won’t be evil, electro was just sad that no one cared about his birthday and when he turned into electro everyone started to shoot him, Green Goblin 2002 was forced to take the Goblin Serum so the company don’t fall but certainly the serum was not finished 100% and it has some side effects"
The best movie and hype i ever experienced. Truely this made me so happy.<br><br>I so want to relive that hype. Again. <br><br>Pls god make a better movie than this and make us relive the hype.
"This is not a movie, this is an emotion for us🙂"
Dooone
U know.whats funny we can all be spider man just move up In a nice neighborhood in New York and let aunt may send u yo college 😅😂
"Most overrated and sh*ttest movie I&#39;ve ever seen. This is just a stupid fan service, I don&#39;t understand why people call it &quot;A Masterpiece&quot; 😅😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=56"">0:56</a>"
My prediction 2 years ago was 65 percent right
"Peter, you’re struggling to have everything you want.  While the world tries to make you choose."
wanna watch it again in the theater plsss.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=151"">2:31</a> I knew deep down they were bringing Andrew back for this scene when I first saw it and it made me extremely happy"
Best movie till now 🎉🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When I watched this I cried seeing Tobey maguire my childhood spider man was back we need spider man 4 cos Tobey has still got it
Where&#39;s toby and garfield💀💀💀💀
"Bro really started from being a ballet dancer, to spiderman and then taking backshots. Bro isn&#39;t shooting webs, he&#39;s getting webs shot into him."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=91"">1:31</a><br><br>“You’re flying out into the darkness to fight ghosts”<br><br>Line never gets old"
Dude I remember being so hyped for this move that when I saw the green goblin on screen for the first time I jump in my seat and maybe almost shouted
"I remember what I was doing when this released, I was chilling, Watching Call Me Kevin play Until Dawn, When I saw that this trailer came out, And that was my best November 16th ever"
"Sony, my point is that the Andrew Garfield trilogy should end.  After the movies morbius and kraven the hunter, the amazing spider-man 3 should also be made. we should see shailene woodley as mary jane watson and the sinister six that will probably be created through oscorp and andrew garfield&#39;s black suit"
"They weren&#39;t fooling anyone, tom landing on his own in a wide shot, the villains coming into toms universe with no hero, sandman and lizard diving for no one 😂😂"
Spider-man is now more popular than Batman.
yay
Can’t believe almost two years since this movie was coming out. I remember how insane the hype was. Good times🥲
Take me back!!
nice movie with handsomessss
I can&#39;t wait to see Spider-Man 50: Old Folks Home.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=110"">1:50</a>"
Great movie Tom holland is a really good actor
i want to go back in time to watch this movie for the first time again and know all the characters there (i wasnt a marvel fan before nwh)
Salman is Bruce Banner
Aamir is Norman Osborne<br>Shah Rukh is Tony Stark.
"It&#39;s been a year.. but still, i blame aunt may for everything.. just stay dead may... godddd"
You’re telling me that this one trailer got 80 MILLION views!! Dam spider man must be marvels fav
"I went to a pre-release of the movie at 12 PM and I can’t explain how close I was to losing my voice due to all the screaming. Jesus, the hype for this movie was so damn worth it."
"If there was a time machine to go back to late 2021 to relive the hype, I would."

Across the spider verse is out and this movie is still so amazing🔥
"Because of Brazil, we knew Tobey and Andrew were in this film"
I would watch this trailer every day when it first came out
Still The Greatest Marvel Superhero Movie Of All Time
I feel bad for those people that didn’t experience this movie like the rest of us
"The HYPE around this movie was INSANE…, I will never forget how excited people were to watch this movie"
Bro the hype for this was crazy!<br>“Is Tobey and Andrew Garfield gonna be in no way home?”<br>Good times😂
Great movie
"&quot;Peter, your struggling, to have everything you want, while the world tries to make you choose&quot;"
Crazy how I just seen this movie today and I even missed the pre hype to it smh never even seen the trailer until now but definitely top 5
LET ME PAY YOU! NOW!!
But where is Venom?
Green Goblin: Peter your struggling to have everything you want while the world tries to make you choose.
"&quot;Maybe she didn&#39;t die for nothing,  peter &quot; ❤️‍🩹"
"Here after watching the movie😂. This my favorite Spiderman movie cause the superhero has to deal with the real consequences of his actions. I know if Peter had just let Dr strange send the villains home there would be no plot. However the consequences of peter choosing otherwise made me so happy, don&#39;t try to change fate."
Trailer purposely doesn’t show Andrew and tobey
"wow, 1 year and 8 months since the movie came out already"
When dr strange said ‘please Scooby doo this crap’ in the movie he actually says ‘please Scooby doo this sh*t’ which is quite funny 😂
Guys if you look lose at this movie when they were fighting thanos nearly returned
i have goosebumps 😢😢😢😢
Why am I here again?
Trailer &gt; Movie
One of the most overrated super hero movies of all time.
This is an unforgettable experience
"Literally, this trailer broke the internet"
Best Spiderman movie ever
"WTH, I gotta watch this again!!!!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=132"">2:12</a>"
"Best spiderman movie. This movie will age very well, too bad the future watchers of this wont understand the hype very well even if they knew it was a callback from all the previous spiderman movies because those old spiderman movies never became their childhood nostalgia movies."
I wanna go back to opening night when I saw it just to relive how the theater screamed when Garfield jumped through that portal
Once in lifetime experience to watch this movie in theatre&#39;s that I missed I&#39;m never gonna forgive myself for that.
"Overrated movie in my opinion, This movie isn’t going to age very well."
这是电影非常有意义的价值，人生有些无法重来
Un año de la película que nos dio más manija que nunca
"Wait did guys not notice something, in the scene where Tom/Peter charges at electro, lizard, and sandman, electro and sandman seem to not go after Pete but at something or someone else, 2 other people that are helping Tom/Peter fight them, Tobey and Andrew."
Canon event
I’m still hype when I see the trailer😂
"I still shed tears of emotion, watching this trailer"
"Spider-Boy...ir Spider-Teen is more apopro. And how could they have a middle-aged vllian fighting a teen, tryna kill him?"
"When this trailer first dropped, I remember how hyped everyone got when the &quot;Hello Peter&quot; happened, the theater i was in went nuts"
"Don&#39;t, it&#39;s a canon event"
"come to think of it , mcu peter tried to interfere with a canonical event first before miles"
June 2023. I got Nostalgia dude
They insult Spider man too much by making three different person
"The movie was the best, ngl. Thank god a Spider-Man 4 is coming."
"i re watched today and Strange said &quot;scooby doo this shit&quot; it felt so weird i had to check it, i knew he said crap somewhere."
Idc what anyone ever says this movie was the biggest event in spiderman history
In my opinion a better movie than across the spiderverse
Can’t believe it’s almost 2 years ago just felt like yesterday I remember getting hyped for this movie
Best spider man tom holland
That was his canon event!
This movie. Amazing. An experience. Just… just utterly 🥲 EVERYTHING
Would love to see Tom and elisabeth s characters together
This is the most Legendary movie
"I’m just wondering why a trex roar from Jurassic park is the sound of a car being smashed at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=47"">0:47</a>"
"Future generations will never understand the hype we build up waiting for this movie to be released 😭😭,this is by far the greatest movie marvel made"
I wish I could watch this movie for the first time in theaters again
This movie was so hype!!! Everyone hoped for Tobey and Andrew and watching this in the movie theater was so much fun!
This movie was so hype!!! Everyone hoped for Tobey and Andrew and watching this in the movie theater was so much fun!
I think I was more pumped up for this movie then I was 4 endgame or Infinity War
1 year but why this part is not on netflix?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=135"">2:15</a> what Dr.Strange and that little nerd did back on Earth 19999."
They are so many Tom Holland spider man movies that end with home now I think there will be a &quot;spider man homeless&quot;movie lol
bro was trying to stop a canon event
I just can&#39;t wait for the next one🎉🎉
Watchin it even after 2 years gives me goosebumps🙃
"Anybody here after Spider-Man Across The Spider Verse? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=161"">2:41</a>"
So let’s do the pros and cons. GF and best friend don’t get into college of their choice. So instead of that? Aunt May dies and the his GF and BF and the world forgets who he is. Bringing back all the old cast members was great idea. But the storyline of casting a spell (while he continues to talk to Dr. Strange) because friends didn’t get into college of their choice and they still would have got into after saved Deans life. That storyline is the worse of ALL the Marvel movies and even some of the DC. 😉.  I thought “Far Away from Home” a lot better Jake Gyllenhaal was great villain even if lil far fetched and few holes.
Garbage film. Into the spiderverse and across the spiderverse is better
Aphelia Ophelia
This cool
No one in the future will understand the hype around this movie
