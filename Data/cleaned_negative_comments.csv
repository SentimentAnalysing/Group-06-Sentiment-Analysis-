I just saw it - really not much better than Black Widow or Captain Marvel.  It really is a shame because I normally love all of the spider-man actors and actresses from the past few movies.

Aunt may dies<br>3. Tobey and Andrew show up in his verse <br>4. Saddest.. everyone forgets Peter Parker like everyone which leads that everyone again forgets the identity of spider man and thus Peter Parker is completely alone in his life 😥😢",True
Movie was alright. They literally only fought the big villains and no smaller criminals which i found very boring. The CGI looked crap at some points like when jamie foxx&#39;s arms looked like rubber/plastic while he was hovering in the air. I feel like tobey and andrew should have gotten out of the portals in a more dramatic way. Its for sure a movie that has to be watched but for me i will only watch it once since it really feeled like that all the money went into getting all 3 spidermans together. This movie all in all felt like an excuse to bring all 3 together to grab some cash. There was literally no point in jake gyllenhal revealing the identity of spiderman...like at all.,True
I watched the movie and now I watch the teailers again and how stupid they are. them laughing at doc ock or mj and strange shitty talk,True

"I see a lot of people saying this movie is a masterpiece, calling this movie a masterpiece just for the fact that all 3 spiderman appeared is just nonsense, this movie is extremely badly written, I&#39;m not saying it is a bad movie, seeing the 3 spiderman unite is quite unique, however the movie relies heavily on nostalgia, that&#39;s the only thing that makes it good, take away Garfield and Maguire and it will just be a regular movie with bad CGI and a poorly written plot... comparing this to actual masterpieces should be ilegal",True
Dr. strange has the strongest domain expansion.,True

Poor kid always ends the film in an unrewarding situation 😭.",True

We have the impression that the spider-man is written to entertain the gallery, young children. For the budget put in I admit to being surprised. <b>People see Marvel and are unable to judge the movie</b> as if it came out of an independent studio. It’s not far from a 2/5 I think. After those who put a 4.2/5 put a 2.5/5 to the new James Bond (75% real scene)... It’s hard to judge a movie but try to figure out how to film, do a VFX, 3D and you’ll be able to recalculate",True

I don’t like the fact his aunt was murdered because of his choice . I don’t like the fact the writer set an example that is not realistic . The moral of the movie for me was if you are being robbed by a criminal give the criminal the keys to your car to drive away with  , open your door and let the criminal in your home and assist them with stealing your property. If your family gets hurt in the process it’s ok because you must be kind all the time even if you are being violently attacked are robbed. STUPID CONCEPT !",True
