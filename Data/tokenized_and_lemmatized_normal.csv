"MOVIE REVIEW <br>       Spider Man: No Way Home is the third movie in the Spider Man trilogy starring Tom Holland. As a warning, going forward this review will contain spoilers. In this story of action, love, and self-sacrifice, Peter Parker, a seemingly ordinary high school senior, faces several trials after his identity as Spider Man is revealed to the public. When his new reputation threatens his chances of being accepted into college, with the help of Dr. Strange, he tries to cast a spell that will cause the world to forget that he is Spider Man. However, Peter messes up the spell and accidentally brings villains from various universes into his own universe. With the help of Dr. Strange, his friends, and heroes from the other universes, Peter makes an honorable sacrifice and saves the world from the villains. <br><br>       I thought that this movie was incredibly enjoyable. The film itself was skillfully developed with an interesting plot, talented actors, and impressive cinematography. One aspect of the plot that I especially appreciated was the balance of action and dialogue within the movie, each which added to the progression of the storyline. The plot also has a relevant and inspiring message about the importance of doing what is right and the nobleness of self-sacrifice. Although none of the characters always make the right choices, the film makes it clear how their good choices bring more positivity into their situations while their rash or unethical decisions negatively impact them. When they make bad decisions, the non-repentant characters, such as the villains, are defeated while the ones who work to correct their mistakes, although they may suffer, are victorious. This conveys the message that even when people make bad decisions, there is merit in persevering and striving for what is good.  For example, when Peter disobeys Dr. Strange, the villains come into the universe and threaten his city. However, when Peter, recognizing that he was wrong, takes responsibility for his disobedience and chooses to work with others in an attempt to stop the villains, it has a positive impact on the world that he is striving to protect. Throughout the film, several characters, such as Peter Parker, Aunt May, and MJ, have to make difficult decisions that involve significant sacrifice. It is a truth-filled film that acknowledges and has an appropriate attitude towards the beauty of the virtuous actions of Peter Parker and his friends and the ugliness of any actions motivated by the evil intentions of the villains. Even though the film has a fictional plot, the moral themes within the movie as well as the virtuous actions of the characters can be influential to todayÃ??s society. I also appreciated how the movie respected the dignity of the human person. Although there was death within the movie, particularly the death of Aunt May, the movie acknowledged the tragedy of her death appropriately and honored the sacrifice that she made. One aspect of the movie that I did not appreciate was that there was some unnecessary language. However, overall, I found Spider Man: No Way Home to be an impressive film production.",positive,"['MOVIE', 'REVIEW', '<', 'br', '>', '      ', 'Spider', 'Man', 'Way', 'Home', 'movie', 'Spider', 'Man', 'trilogy', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Holland', 'warning', 'going', 'forward', 'review', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'story', 'action', 'love', 'self', 'sacrifice', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'seemingly', 'ordinary', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'faces', 'trials', 'identity', 'Spider', 'Man', 'revealed', 'public', 'new', 'reputation', 'threatens', 'chances', 'accepted', 'college', 'help', 'Dr.', 'Strange', 'tries', 'cast', 'spell', 'cause', 'world', 'forget', 'Spider', 'Man', 'Peter', 'messes', 'spell', 'accidentally', 'brings', 'villains', 'universes', 'universe', 'help', 'Dr.', 'Strange', 'friends', 'heroes', 'universes', 'Peter', 'makes', 'honorable', 'sacrifice', 'saves', 'world', 'villains', '<', 'br><br', '>', '      ', 'thought', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'skillfully', 'developed', 'interesting', 'plot', 'talented', 'actors', 'impressive', 'cinematography', 'aspect', 'plot', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'balance', 'action', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'added', 'progression', 'storyline', 'plot', 'relevant', 'inspiring', 'message', 'importance', 'right', 'nobleness', 'self', 'sacrifice', 'characters', 'right', 'choices', 'film', 'makes', 'clear', 'good', 'choices', 'bring', 'positivity', 'situations', 'rash', 'unethical', 'decisions', 'negatively', 'impact', 'bad', 'decisions', 'non', 'repentant', 'characters', 'villains', 'defeated', 'ones', 'work', 'correct', 'mistakes', 'suffer', 'victorious', 'conveys', 'message', 'people', 'bad', 'decisions', 'merit', 'persevering', 'striving', 'good', ' ', 'example', 'Peter', 'disobeys', 'Dr.', 'Strange', 'villains', 'come', 'universe', 'threaten', 'city', 'Peter', 'recognizing', 'wrong', 'takes', 'responsibility', 'disobedience', 'chooses', 'work', 'attempt', 'stop', 'villains', 'positive', 'impact', 'world', 'striving', 'protect', 'film', 'characters', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Aunt', 'MJ', 'difficult', 'decisions', 'involve', 'significant', 'sacrifice', 'truth', 'filled', 'film', 'acknowledges', 'appropriate', 'attitude', 'beauty', 'virtuous', 'actions', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'friends', 'ugliness', 'actions', 'motivated', 'evil', 'intentions', 'villains', 'film', 'fictional', 'plot', 'moral', 'themes', 'movie', 'virtuous', 'actions', 'characters', 'influential', 'todayÃ\x89??s', 'society', 'appreciated', 'movie', 'respected', 'dignity', 'human', 'person', 'death', 'movie', 'particularly', 'death', 'Aunt', 'movie', 'acknowledged', 'tragedy', 'death', 'appropriately', 'honored', 'sacrifice', 'aspect', 'movie', 'appreciate', 'unnecessary', 'language', 'overall', 'found', 'Spider', 'Man', 'Way', 'Home', 'impressive', 'film', 'production']",movie REVIEW < br >         Spider Man Way Home movie Spider Man trilogy star Tom Holland warn go forward review contain spoiler story action love self sacrifice Peter Parker seemingly ordinary high school senior face trial identity Spider Man reveal public new reputation threaten chance accept college help Dr. Strange try cast spell cause world forget Spider Man Peter mess spell accidentally bring villain universe universe help Dr. strange friend hero universe Peter make honorable sacrifice save world villain < br><br >         think movie incredibly enjoyable film skillfully develop interesting plot talented actor impressive cinematography aspect plot especially appreciated balance action dialogue movie add progression storyline plot relevant inspiring message importance right nobleness self sacrifice character right choice film make clear good choice bring positivity situation rash unethical decision negatively impact bad decision non repentant character villain defeat one work correct mistake suffer victorious convey message people bad decision merit persevere strive good    example Peter disobey Dr. strange villain come universe threaten city Peter recognize wrong take responsibility disobedience choose work attempt stop villain positive impact world strive protect film character Peter Parker Aunt MJ difficult decision involve significant sacrifice truth fill film acknowledge appropriate attitude beauty virtuous action Peter Parker friend ugliness action motivate evil intention villain film fictional plot moral theme movie virtuous action character influential todayÃ??s society appreciate movie respect dignity human person death movie particularly death Aunt movie acknowledge tragedy death appropriately honor sacrifice aspect movie appreciate unnecessary language overall find Spider Man Way Home impressive film production

"This was literally better than End Game, possibly even better than Infinity War, the crossover with the spidermen was better than any of the other heroes featuring small little nothingburger roles in other MCU movies, and this is the first one to ever actually incorporate more than ONE villain. Like cool there&#39;s all the heroes in avengers as they fight a bunch of faceless armies from whatever bad guys are in them. But this has multiple noteworthy villains AND they&#39;re actually given wayyy better character development than almost every other bad guy in the mcu that feels like a surface level villain in a cookie cutter movie. This was a peak moment and unless that &#39;Sinister Six&#39; movie that was having rumors about it was a separate thing from this I&#39;m not sure how many more MCU movies we&#39;ll get with more than one villain.

"The ability of the Spider-Man films to portray Peter Parker&#39;s dual lifeÃ??that of an apparently normal teenager juggling the extraordinary responsibilities of being a superheroÃ??is one of their most notable features. The struggle to strike a balance between one&#39;s personal life and one&#39;s responsibilities as a crime-fighting vigilante, whether played by Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, or Tom Holland, is a recurring theme in the films. Because it captures the universal struggle of juggling conflicting facets of one&#39;s life, this theme appeals to audiences.Filmmakers can now vividly depict Spider-Man&#39;s web-slinging stunts and fights against strong adversaries thanks to advancements in visual effects. Movies featuring superhero action sequences that go beyond swinging through New York City skyscrapers and taking on legendary villains like Venom, Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, and the Vulture have set a higher standard.Furthermore, what sets Spider-Man movies apart is how moral quandaries and the human side of superheroes are portrayed. Audiences are deeply impacted by Peter Parker&#39;s internal struggles, his desire to do good, and the sacrifices he makes for the greater good. In conclusion, by fusing exciting action, gripping narrative, and likable characters, Spider-Man films have irrevocably altered the film industry. These movies, which feature everyone&#39;s favorite amiable neighborhood superhero, never fail to enthrall audiences, whether they&#39;re swinging across cityscapes or navigating life&#39;s challenges.",positive,"['ability', 'Spider', 'Man', 'films', 'portray', 'Peter', 'Parker&#39;s', 'dual', 'lifeÃ\x89??that', 'apparently', 'normal', 'teenager', 'juggling', 'extraordinary', 'responsibilities', 'superheroÃ\x89??is', 'notable', 'features', 'struggle', 'strike', 'balance', 'one&#39;s', 'personal', 'life', 'one&#39;s', 'responsibilities', 'crime', 'fighting', 'vigilante', 'played', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Tom', 'Holland', 'recurring', 'theme', 'films', 'captures', 'universal', 'struggle', 'juggling', 'conflicting', 'facets', 'one&#39;s', 'life', 'theme', 'appeals', 'audiences', 'Filmmakers', 'vividly', 'depict', 'Spider', 'Man&#39;s', 'web', 'slinging', 'stunts', 'fights', 'strong', 'adversaries', 'thanks', 'advancements', 'visual', 'effects', 'Movies', 'featuring', 'superhero', 'action', 'sequences', 'swinging', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'skyscrapers', 'taking', 'legendary', 'villains', 'like', 'Venom', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Vulture', 'set', 'higher', 'standard', 'Furthermore', 'sets', 'Spider', 'Man', 'movies', 'apart', 'moral', 'quandaries', 'human', 'superheroes', 'portrayed', 'Audiences', 'deeply', 'impacted', 'Peter', 'Parker&#39;s', 'internal', 'struggles', 'desire', 'good', 'sacrifices', 'makes', 'greater', 'good', 'conclusion', 'fusing', 'exciting', 'action', 'gripping', 'narrative', 'likable', 'characters', 'Spider', 'Man', 'films', 'irrevocably', 'altered', 'film', 'industry', 'movies', 'feature', 'everyone&#39;s', 'favorite', 'amiable', 'neighborhood', 'superhero', 'fail', 'enthrall', 'audiences', 'they&#39;re', 'swinging', 'cityscapes', 'navigating', 'life&#39;s', 'challenges']",ability Spider Man film portray Peter Parker&#39;s dual lifeã??that apparently normal teenager juggle extraordinary responsibility superheroã??i notable feature struggle strike balance one&#39;s personal life one&#39;s responsibilitie crime fighting vigilante play Tobey Maguire Andrew Garfield Tom Holland recur theme film capture universal struggle juggle conflict facet one&#39;s life theme appeal audience Filmmakers vividly depict Spider Man&#39;s web sling stunt fight strong adversary thanks advancement visual effect movie feature superhero action sequence swinge New York City skyscraper take legendary villain like Venom Doctor Octopus Green Goblin Vulture set high standard Furthermore set Spider Man movie apart moral quandary human superhero portray audience deeply impact Peter Parker&#39;s internal struggle desire good sacrifice make great good conclusion fuse exciting action grip narrative likable character Spider Man film irrevocably alter film industry movie feature everyone&#39; favorite amiable neighborhood superhero fail enthrall audience they&#39;re swinge cityscape navigate life&#39;s challenge

Movie was alright. They literally only fought the big villains and no smaller criminals which i found very boring. The CGI looked crap at some points like when jamie foxx&#39;s arms looked like rubber/plastic while he was hovering in the air. I feel like tobey and andrew should have gotten out of the portals in a more dramatic way.

"The story has no logic, three parallel universes, the characters who were killed at the moment before death were transferred through a portal to the same universe, and they have the possibility to repair themselves so that they do not die, if electro transferred at the moment of death and everyone else to that portal, how did gwen die When parallel events occur in similar ways. When The Amazing Spider-Man says: I lost Gwen, that was my M.J. she died 8 years ago. And events are like parallel worlds. This part changes the fate of the people from the previous parts, it changes the story. The best Spiderman was Amazing. Everyone saw that the evil characters died as well as the good ones, doesn&#39;t the fate of the killed people change, if the fight is not over, if it ends in Spiderman no back home, these characters become good, when they return to their parallel worlds and Spiderman there is no risk of fighting them, if norman died in the first part then spiderman 2 and 3 were filmed for no reason. Because the first part is parallel to this universe and Norman was transferred to this universe before his death. Dr. Octivius is looking for P.P. of old because he does not know what happened in the moment before he was submerged, he was transferred to this universe. Where they say the moment the power of the sun was in my palm I was transferred here. In my opinion, you should have corrected the story and continued filming P.P and Gwen.

It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

"Originally, they were thinking about including more characters from the other movies for this. They would&#39;ve included Kirsten Dunst&#39;s MJ, Emma Stones&#39; Gwen, Rhino from TASM2, Dane DeHaan&#39;s Green Goblin from TASM2, and even more of Tom Hardy&#39;s Venom. Mysterio was actually supposed to be brought in for a battle with Dr. Strange. I think maybe it could&#39;ve worked if this story was spilt into two movies like with Infinity War and Endgame. With that, Part 1 would be more of Tom&#39;s movie and it would end with him meeting Tobey and Andrew to get help which would set up the events of the sequel. But obviously they couldn&#39;t do more than one because of how Sony is currently doing those animated Spider-Verse movies and Across The Spider-Verse is going to be split into two movies themselves. I hope Tobey, Andrew, and Tom make an appearance in Part Two. Also, it would be really cool that another No Way Home is made with Tobey, Andrew, and Tom. But they should include the other characters that werenÃ??t included. Michelle Jones would meet Mary Jane and could find out how sheÃ??s married to Tobey and that they are probably parents. Mary Jane could inspires Michelle to dye her hair red. They would also meet Gwen and find out how she was supposed to go to Oxford and Andrew would have a tearful reunion with her. When she goes back home, she will avoid her death. If TASM3 does happen, Shailene Woodley could make an appearance and Gwen will feel around her. In addition, Kirsten DunstÃ??s MJ will feel weird around EmmaÃ??s Gwen because of how she didnÃ??t get along with Bryce Dallas HowardÃ??s. We could see Dane DeHaanÃ??s Harry get cured from his disease and he will be sorry for everything he did. Rhino could make an appearance, but in a real battle this time. Maybe Topher Grace and Tom Hardy could battle. It would be interesting to see what both of their symbiotes could do with each other. I donÃ??t know if James Franco would return, but it would be a touching reunion with him, Tobey, and Kirsten on screen. Maybe Vulture, Shocker, and Mysterio could appear too.

We didn&#39;t have internet like we do now with data and cellphones.. so for us.. he just vanished... And was replaced by Andrew... And then 2 movies later... Another spiderman... <br><br>Each director told us a story... In their own way... And because they each remembered things differently... There were differences... <br><br>And we were asked to forget the previous movies... Because it was like a slate being wiped clean and irrelevant to the current happenings... <br><br>This was a breaking of the fourth wall for us...  By having them break the third...<br><br>The only other time this happened?? X-Men first class (mystique). <br><br>... So yes... There was a great deal of hype... Because then unlike now.. we didn&#39;t expect that it would have been the last time for us to see either of them as spiderman again... <br><br><br>Stated another way... Imagine 70 years from now... A reboot of James Cameron&#39;s titanic.... But the old lady telling the story is kate Winslet <br><br>Or 19 years from now... An ironman reboot...

With this film Hollywood did the impossible<br><br><br>Oh! And fyi... It&#39;s the X-Men and spiderman that made enough money and got the MCU happening...
