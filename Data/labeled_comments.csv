"The ability of the Spider-Man films to portray Peter Parker&#39;s dual life—that of an apparently normal teenager juggling the extraordinary responsibilities of being a superhero—is one of their most notable features. The struggle to strike a balance between one&#39;s personal life and one&#39;s responsibilities as a crime-fighting vigilante, whether played by Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, or Tom Holland, is a recurring theme in the films. Because it captures the universal struggle of juggling conflicting facets of one&#39;s life, this theme appeals to audiences.Filmmakers can now vividly depict Spider-Man&#39;s web-slinging stunts and fights against strong adversaries thanks to advancements in visual effects. Movies featuring superhero action sequences that go beyond swinging through New York City skyscrapers and taking on legendary villains like Venom, Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, and the Vulture have set a higher standard.Furthermore, what sets Spider-Man movies apart is how moral quandaries and the human side of superheroes are portrayed. Audiences are deeply impacted by Peter Parker&#39;s internal struggles, his desire to do good, and the sacrifices he makes for the greater good. In conclusion, by fusing exciting action, gripping narrative, and likable characters, Spider-Man films have irrevocably altered the film industry. These movies, which feature everyone&#39;s favorite amiable neighborhood superhero, never fail to enthrall audiences, whether they&#39;re swinging across cityscapes or navigating life&#39;s challenges.",positive

So let’s do the pros and cons. GF and best friend don’t get into college of their choice. So instead of that? Aunt May dies and the his GF and BF and the world forgets who he is. Bringing back all the old cast members was great idea. But the storyline of casting a spell (while he continues to talk to Dr. Strange) because friends didn’t get into college of their choice and they still would have got into after saved Deans life. That storyline is the worse of ALL the Marvel movies and even some of the DC. 😉.  I thought “Far Away from Home” a lot better Jake Gyllenhaal was great villain even if lil far fetched and few holes.,positive

The first half disappointed me as it wasn&#39;t what I hoped and I found the humour very intrusive in what is quite a dark film but from the electro and sand man fight onwards I became really invested and loved it. Not in my top ten MCU films but definitely the best MCU spider man film, probably 5th best spider man film overall and easily top 15 MCU films. Great film and great experience",positive

But that&#39;s all tv has on it these days.. so got sucked in..<br><br>It was excellent.. thought I&#39;d come read comments and realized that some (many) don&#39;t feel the same... <br><br>So decided to comment.. to put things in perspective.<br><br>See i saw the first spidermen in cinema... There was hype... All we had before this eas batman and superman movies... Xmen also just took off... These were cartoons that we grew up with that shaped us in more ways than we knew.. so it was important to us to see these characters come to life on the big screen...<br><br><br>Tobey was our first spiderman... We didn&#39;t have internet like we do now with data and cellphones.. so for us.. he just vanished... And was replaced by Andrew... And then 2 movies later... Another spiderman... <br><br>Each director told us a story... In their own way... And because they each remembered things differently... There were differences... <br><br>And we were asked to forget the previous movies... Because it was like a slate being wiped clean and irrelevant to the current happenings... <br><br>This was a breaking of the fourth wall for us...  By having them break the third...<br><br>The only other time this happened?? X-Men first class (mystique). <br><br>... So yes... There was a great deal of hype... Because then unlike now.. we didn&#39;t expect that it would have been the last time for us to see either of them as spiderman again... <br><br><br>Stated another way... Imagine 70 years from now... A reboot of James Cameron&#39;s titanic.... But the old lady telling the story is kate Winslet <br><br>Or 19 years from now... An ironman reboot... With Robert Downey Jr. <br><br>Or perhaps my best example yet.... A strange world where heath ledger and Joachin Phoenix square off against keaton and  kilmer.<br><br>Or all the bond actors together in one film...<br><br>See.... It&#39;s impossible... .... ... With this film Hollywood did the impossible<br><br><br>Oh! And fyi... It&#39;s the X-Men and spiderman that made enough money and got the MCU happening... Because it was profitable and people wanted more... <br><br>Compared to hulk, green lantern, and a lot of other shitty superhero movies along the way<br><br>(Yes lantern is DC.. but my point is the real world isn&#39;t isolated like that... They&#39;re all one big genre)<br><br>.... Goblin... Oc... Those characters died on us... And we felt it... So to see them.. in the ORIGINAL format....  We fans were done justice...a proper homage. They brought 3 generations of spiderman fans together in a way I don&#39;t see happening anytime soon until X-Men finds it&#39;s way",positive

"I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=72"">1:12</a>. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA&amp;t=394"">6:34</a> that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don&#39;t think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life.

The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I&#39;m struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing.

1 Year ago we witnessed the Most greatest Spiderman Movie ever,positive
"The movie is already 1 year old!!!<br>It definitely shows a sad face of our reality; anyone whom is accused of something or under suspicion people are ready to turn on them and get violent <br>Peter is facing a true struggle; is it true everywhere Spider-Man goes chaos and calamity ensues? Whatever damage is left behind we have to pick up the pieces <br>Can you actually fix someone, we should give people second chances to start over rather than meet our fate, a simple solution isn’t the only solution, can we do more than expect disappointment therefore avoiding disappointment?, morality isn’t a weakness, revenge never makes anything better <br>After 20 years I can safely say this was absolutely worth that wait! <br>Intense action, the stakes are the highest they&#39;ve ever been for Spider-Man, and there&#39;s a ton of heavy emotional beats I wasn&#39;t ready for <br>Terrific to see past actors come back from previous franchises and lots of nods to the culture of the character; even Green Goblin gets more exploration trying to suppress his dual personality but with little success plus Electro gets a good course correction since his birth and Doc Ock is offered a way out without being power hungry with his hubris, more sympathy for these individuals rather than being straight up bad guys <br>More stuff centering about rehabilitation as opposed to just jailing up people <br>I wish more of the villains were explored further  but the film delivers enough for longtime fans plus it&#39;s the best acted from Tom Holland as this current version <br>He really does bring the central core of the character full circle with sorrow, guilt, regret, and being responsible <br>Love how Ned gets to be more proactive next to MJ too <br>The climax is astounding visually and emotionally <br>I am curious how future movies will benefit from this now that Marvel and Sony are finally collaborating  <br>The movie is about looking backwards but learning to go forwards and there will always be consequences trying to change things or set things right not to mention showing the test of what it means to be a hero let alone what it costs, sacrifice and sparing others pain <br>Director Jon Watts closes this cycle of Spider-Man movies with quite a jolt not forgetting the human drama, exciting fights, and embracing the colorful fun of the comics <br>Best movie of 2021 and one of the best Spider-Man movies period!",positive

This absolute <i>masterpiece</i> of a trailer for this absolute <i>masterpiece</i> of a movie came out <i>exactly</i> one year ago, <i>today!!!</i> And I <i>still</i> get chills whenever I watch it. This movie was a once in a lifetime experience that I don&#39;t think will be recreated by Marvel or any other film studio for that matter, no matter how hard they might try to do so. There will never be another cinematic experience quite like Spider-Man: No Way Home. Even after all this time, it still feels like a dream to see all <i>three</i> Spider-Men in the same movie together and all get their time to shine. Everything for this movie was just pure <i>perfection!</i> I think Homelander said it best:&quot;It was perfect. <i>Perfect.</i> Everything. Down to the last minute details&quot;.",positive

"Spider-crap. Probably One of the worst movies ever created. The worst ir the Century for sure. How can you Invest só much Money n a crap such as this movie. The script is a joke, carácters full with left wing polítical LGBT, and other agendas. The zombie generation Addicted to Smart phones, só annoying, Impossible technology, etc... Tryng to avoid old clichês, they come up with new ones, like a black MJ, a hot ant May. Peter Parker best friend is probably the ugliest man Alive. An Indian flash?!?! OMG and all this on purpose, like if the audience was stupid",negative
"I used to be a great fan of spider man movies, that is, of the first three, with tobey macguire. Theses last movies are so bad. They want to be cool, and trendy. Both the movie and the characters are so annoying, wanting to be cool everytime, and they want  to break sipder-man tradition, with all these Leftism/LGBT agenda&#39;s cliches, that it ends so FAKE, and iritating. Thes last spider man remind me those adolecent movies of the 80s, filled with cliches. Now they are packed with 2020&#39;s cliches, like the constant usage of smart phones, and people trying to look cool... they want to give the impression that super heros could be something normal in our society, that it ends sounding so fony... In fact, I cannot watch more than 5 minutes of these new super-heros new films, not even to watch the great special CGI effects... so much money spent in these crappy movies.",positive

"I have to say, I thought Toby Maguire was hands down THE best Spider-Man and Peter Parker, his first two films were untouched by far from home, homecoming, and all of Garfield’s movies<br><br>But this movie made me cry 4 full times, not even tobys movie did this to me but I suppose it’s the history that made all that happened in this movie stronger.<br><br>This movie is finally the direction I wanted them to take Tom Holland in, the serious and dark tone, the consequences, the sacrifices, everything Tom should go through that makes us relate to him even more.<br><br>One of the best movies I’ve seen, I think non fans and fans and skeptical people should watch this, I would place this with Toby’s first two movies as one of all time greats, and it has alota cool fan services that we get to see but also very raw and real moments that make the movie geniune, Garfield was great too and am glad he gets to show off the people that hated on him",positive

"MOVIE REVIEW <br>       Spider Man: No Way Home is the third movie in the Spider Man trilogy starring Tom Holland. As a warning, going forward this review will contain spoilers. In this story of action, love, and self-sacrifice, Peter Parker, a seemingly ordinary high school senior, faces several trials after his identity as Spider Man is revealed to the public. When his new reputation threatens his chances of being accepted into college, with the help of Dr. Strange, he tries to cast a spell that will cause the world to forget that he is Spider Man. However, Peter messes up the spell and accidentally brings villains from various universes into his own universe. With the help of Dr. Strange, his friends, and heroes from the other universes, Peter makes an honorable sacrifice and saves the world from the villains. <br><br>       I thought that this movie was incredibly enjoyable. The film itself was skillfully developed with an interesting plot, talented actors, and impressive cinematography. One aspect of the plot that I especially appreciated was the balance of action and dialogue within the movie, each which added to the progression of the storyline. The plot also has a relevant and inspiring message about the importance of doing what is right and the nobleness of self-sacrifice. Although none of the characters always make the right choices, the film makes it clear how their good choices bring more positivity into their situations while their rash or unethical decisions negatively impact them. When they make bad decisions, the non-repentant characters, such as the villains, are defeated while the ones who work to correct their mistakes, although they may suffer, are victorious. This conveys the message that even when people make bad decisions, there is merit in persevering and striving for what is good.  For example, when Peter disobeys Dr. Strange, the villains come into the universe and threaten his city. However, when Peter, recognizing that he was wrong, takes responsibility for his disobedience and chooses to work with others in an attempt to stop the villains, it has a positive impact on the world that he is striving to protect. Throughout the film, several characters, such as Peter Parker, Aunt May, and MJ, have to make difficult decisions that involve significant sacrifice. It is a truth-filled film that acknowledges and has an appropriate attitude towards the beauty of the virtuous actions of Peter Parker and his friends and the ugliness of any actions motivated by the evil intentions of the villains. Even though the film has a fictional plot, the moral themes within the movie as well as the virtuous actions of the characters can be influential to today’s society. I also appreciated how the movie respected the dignity of the human person. Although there was death within the movie, particularly the death of Aunt May, the movie acknowledged the tragedy of her death appropriately and honored the sacrifice that she made. One aspect of the movie that I did not appreciate was that there was some unnecessary language. However, overall, I found Spider Man: No Way Home to be an impressive film production.",positive

"The story has no logic, three parallel universes, the characters who were killed at the moment before death were transferred through a portal to the same universe, and they have the possibility to repair themselves so that they do not die, if electro transferred at the moment of death and everyone else to that portal, how did gwen die When parallel events occur in similar ways. When The Amazing Spider-Man says: I lost Gwen, that was my M.J. she died 8 years ago. And events are like parallel worlds. This part changes the fate of the people from the previous parts, it changes the story. The best Spiderman was Amazing. Everyone saw that the evil characters died as well as the good ones, doesn&#39;t the fate of the killed people change, if the fight is not over, if it ends in Spiderman no back home, these characters become good, when they return to their parallel worlds and Spiderman there is no risk of fighting them, if norman died in the first part then spiderman 2 and 3 were filmed for no reason. Because the first part is parallel to this universe and Norman was transferred to this universe before his death. Dr. Octivius is looking for P.P. of old because he does not know what happened in the moment before he was submerged, he was transferred to this universe. Where they say the moment the power of the sun was in my palm I was transferred here. In my opinion, you should have corrected the story and continued filming P.P and Gwen. Because it is the best season of all.<br>This Spider-man is not good.",positive

"This was literally better than End Game, possibly even better than Infinity War, the crossover with the spidermen was better than any of the other heroes featuring small little nothingburger roles in other MCU movies, and this is the first one to ever actually incorporate more than ONE villain. Like cool there&#39;s all the heroes in avengers as they fight a bunch of faceless armies from whatever bad guys are in them. But this has multiple noteworthy villains AND they&#39;re actually given wayyy better character development than almost every other bad guy in the mcu that feels like a surface level villain in a cookie cutter movie. This was a peak moment and unless that &#39;Sinister Six&#39; movie that was having rumors about it was a separate thing from this I&#39;m not sure how many more MCU movies we&#39;ll get with more than one villain. Even Multiverse of Madness didn&#39;t measure up to this, it just had other hero cameos no villains, this was honestly a much better multiverse movie than that unfortunately, this is iconic.",positive

First off we have Mysterio telling everyone that Peter Parker&#39;s spiderman. And then Peter meets Dr Strange. Idk why Dr strange was in the movie. Peter meets the former villains. The villains go berserk. Aunt May is killed. Wasn&#39;t sad at all. Peter meets the two spidermen from different universes. They start attacking the villains and they bring them back to normal. Yay🙄. After that Peter asks Dr Strange to wash off everyone&#39;s memories. BAD ending. Overall this movie was mid.,negative
This ending is so sad😭😭,neutral
Has someone made an edit of the trailer adding Tobey and Andrew? I’d love to rewatch the heck outta that,positive

"Originally, they were thinking about including more characters from the other movies for this. They would&#39;ve included Kirsten Dunst&#39;s MJ, Emma Stones&#39; Gwen, Rhino from TASM2, Dane DeHaan&#39;s Green Goblin from TASM2, and even more of Tom Hardy&#39;s Venom. Mysterio was actually supposed to be brought in for a battle with Dr. Strange. I think maybe it could&#39;ve worked if this story was spilt into two movies like with Infinity War and Endgame. With that, Part 1 would be more of Tom&#39;s movie and it would end with him meeting Tobey and Andrew to get help which would set up the events of the sequel. But obviously they couldn&#39;t do more than one because of how Sony is currently doing those animated Spider-Verse movies and Across The Spider-Verse is going to be split into two movies themselves. I hope Tobey, Andrew, and Tom make an appearance in Part Two. Also, it would be really cool that another No Way Home is made with Tobey, Andrew, and Tom. But they should include the other characters that weren’t included. Michelle Jones would meet Mary Jane and could find out how she’s married to Tobey and that they are probably parents. Mary Jane could inspires Michelle to dye her hair red. They would also meet Gwen and find out how she was supposed to go to Oxford and Andrew would have a tearful reunion with her. When she goes back home, she will avoid her death. If TASM3 does happen, Shailene Woodley could make an appearance and Gwen will feel around her. In addition, Kirsten Dunst’s MJ will feel weird around Emma’s Gwen because of how she didn’t get along with Bryce Dallas Howard’s. We could see Dane DeHaan’s Harry get cured from his disease and he will be sorry for everything he did. Rhino could make an appearance, but in a real battle this time. Maybe Topher Grace and Tom Hardy could battle. It would be interesting to see what both of their symbiotes could do with each other. I don’t know if James Franco would return, but it would be a touching reunion with him, Tobey, and Kirsten on screen. Maybe Vulture, Shocker, and Mysterio could appear too. And since Vulture is teamed up with Morbius, I guess characters from the SSU would appear if Vulture is telling people Peter’s identity.",positive

"Honestly, movie was pretty terrible. I&#39;ve watched the old spiderman movies and loved seeing them communicate but I do not think that nostalgia can fuel this whole movie. Movie was still good but spiderman 2 is ten times better.",positive
I cannot believe this trailer is six months old I legit member when this trailer first came out talk about memories 🥺,positive
Imagine if they showed Tobey and Andrew landing there and they all leaped to attack them. Everyone watching this trailer would&#39;ve had a heart attack,neutral
People should understand that marvel ruined the spiderman character with worst story and graphics. Compare the Tsam 1 and Tasm 2 with Marvel spiderman movies. The graphics are worst 🤢🤮🤮🤮.,negative

Im watching this movie right now and think it is HORRID!!!! the side kick friends DID NOTHING the whole movie that mattered.  Aunt may died for no reason. The two other spiderman are way better and have way better movies. BAD BAD MOVIE!! For anyone over 40 this movie sucked and was for kids who don;t know what good movies are.,positive
Lol if only he just kept his mouth shut. He literally just ignores what Dr. strange is telling him during the spell. Lol,positive
"It felt amazing at first, but now I&#39;m starting to notice the immense amount of potholes. This movie really was just a cash grab.",positive
I now have some understanding on how it felt to know that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker&#39;s father while watching the movie. Too bad for most people who will watch this movie for the first time later would most likely know about the spoiler,positive
"I thought there would be a post-credit scene for the latest Spider-Man movie, which seems like a wasted opportunity, they could have shown what happened to one of the Spider-Man variants or their villains from their perspective back to their timeline, or show a cameo of Nicholas Hammond as Spider-Man missing the fight like Tom Hardy as Venom missed it",positive

this movie was hot trash 😂,positive
Most idiotic movie ever made by Marvel,negative
Spoilers- <br>At first I liked this movie so much but the more I think about it the more I&#39;m becoming disappointed.<br>Specially Peter (Tom) kept pissing me off.<br>I don&#39;t know why MC kept him making stupid and annoying mistakes. Ik he&#39;s Young and new but still.<br>One time they&#39;ll make him super intelligent and the next moment they&#39;ll make him super dumb.<br>Also it was quite confusing. Cause in end game Hulk said that changing the past won&#39;t change what happened. So how Peter changing the villains will change whatever happen to them? <br>And if it worked then in endgame killing baby Thanos should work as well😑<br>Idk. I can be wrong.<br>But still it&#39;s a good movie. And movies don&#39;t go well with logic so sorry for my rant<br>Sorry for bad English.,positive

"After watching this film, i was sad I lost 2 hours for such an stupid film. I was curious about how people thought on the movie.... People do like this film. Then an understand the makers of the movie does understand An know the brain level of the people who do look to these films.
