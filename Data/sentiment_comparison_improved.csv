It sounds just like another one of those confused movies that don't know where they want to go or what they want to be I got so bored watching this intro I went to the kitchen before it even finished and that's not easy to happen Marvel movies are like Dragonball When they start out they make sense but then they try to gradually become more and more epic until they just make no sense and there's nothing in them we can even relate to any longer It's just a pure mess of exaggeration with no defined direction or meaning,negative,positive
This is one of the fanticst movie ever,positive,neutral

MOVIE REVIEW br       Spider Man No Way Home is the third movie in the Spider Man trilogy starring Tom Holland As a warning going forward this review will contain spoilers In this story of action love and selfsacrifice Peter Parker a seemingly ordinary high school senior faces several trials after his identity as Spider Man is revealed to the public When his new reputation threatens his chances of being accepted into college with the help of Dr Strange he tries to cast a spell that will cause the world to forget that he is Spider Man However Peter messes up the spell and accidentally brings villains from various universes into his own universe With the help of Dr Strange his friends and heroes from the other universes Peter makes an honorable sacrifice and saves the world from the villains         I thought that this movie was incredibly enjoyable The film itself was skillfully developed with an interesting plot talented actors and impressive cinematography One aspect of the plot that I especially appreciated was the balance of action and dialogue within the movie each which added to the progression of the storyline The plot also has a relevant and inspiring message about the importance of doing what is right and the nobleness of selfsacrifice Although none of the characters always make the right choices the film makes it clear how their good choices bring more positivity into their situations while their rash or unethical decisions negatively impact them When they make bad decisions the nonrepentant characters such as the villains are defeated while the ones who work to correct their mistakes although they may suffer are victorious This conveys the message that even when people make bad decisions there is merit in persevering and striving for what is good  For example when Peter disobeys Dr Strange the villains come into the universe and threaten his city However when Peter recognizing that he was wrong takes responsibility for his disobedience and chooses to work with others in an attempt to stop the villains it has a positive impact on the world that he is striving to protect Throughout the film several characters such as Peter Parker Aunt May and MJ have to make difficult decisions that involve significant sacrifice It is a truthfilled film that acknowledges and has an appropriate attitude towards the beauty of the virtuous actions of Peter Parker and his friends and the ugliness of any actions motivated by the evil intentions of the villains Even though the film has a fictional plot the moral themes within the movie as well as the virtuous actions of the characters can be influential to todays society I also appreciated how the movie respected the dignity of the human person Although there was death within the movie particularly the death of Aunt May the movie acknowledged the tragedy of her death appropriately and honored the sacrifice that she made One aspect of the movie that I did not appreciate was that there was some unnecessary language However overall I found Spider Man No Way Home to be an impressive film production,positive,positive

This was literally better than End Game possibly even better than Infinity War the crossover with the spidermen was better than any of the other heroes featuring small little nothingburger roles in other MCU movies and this is the first one to ever actually incorporate more than ONE villain Like cool there's all the heroes in avengers as they fight a bunch of faceless armies from whatever bad guys are in them But this has multiple noteworthy villains AND they're actually given wayyy better character development than almost every other bad guy in the mcu that feels like a surface level villain in a cookie cutter movie This was a peak moment and unless that 'Sinister Six' movie that was having rumors about it was a separate thing from this I'm not sure how many more MCU movies we'll get with more than one villain Even Multiverse of Madness didn't measure up to this it just had other hero cameos no villains this was honestly a much better multiverse movie than that unfortunately this is iconic,positive,negative
Mary Jane Looks more like Mariangela to me,positive,positive

Ok  the acting  special effects were great  With that being said I did not enjoy the movie I thought the story line could have been a lot better  I dont like the fact his aunt was murdered because of his choice  I dont like the fact the writer set an example that is not realistic  The moral of the movie for me was if you are being robbed by a criminal give the criminal the keys to your car to drive away with   open your door and let the criminal in your home and assist them with stealing your property If your family gets hurt in the process its ok because you must be kind all the time even if you are being violently attacked are robbed STUPID CONCEPT ,negative,negative

The ability of the SpiderMan films to portray Peter Parker's dual lifethat of an apparently normal teenager juggling the extraordinary responsibilities of being a superherois one of their most notable features The struggle to strike a balance between one's personal life and one's responsibilities as a crimefighting vigilante whether played by Tobey Maguire Andrew Garfield or Tom Holland is a recurring theme in the films Because it captures the universal struggle of juggling conflicting facets of one's life this theme appeals to audiencesFilmmakers can now vividly depict SpiderMan's webslinging stunts and fights against strong adversaries thanks to advancements in visual effects Movies featuring superhero action sequences that go beyond swinging through New York City skyscrapers and taking on legendary villains like Venom Doctor Octopus Green Goblin and the Vulture have set a higher standardFurthermore what sets SpiderMan movies apart is how moral quandaries and the human side of superheroes are portrayed Audiences are deeply impacted by Peter Parker's internal struggles his desire to do good and the sacrifices he makes for the greater good In conclusion by fusing exciting action gripping narrative and likable characters SpiderMan films have irrevocably altered the film industry These movies which feature everyone's favorite amiable neighborhood superhero never fail to enthrall audiences whether they're swinging across cityscapes or navigating life's challenges,positive,positive

Not sure if it is the bad writing or the fact that Tom Holland is the worst of the three last Spiderman characters   The line of laughing at Dr Otto's name is just lame  high school level writing asking please hahaha it is just so bad and in the previous movie Peter Parker acts like he is a high school nerd with nothing going for him and yet previously he helped save the world and still he is insecure   All of it is really the worst writing and the worst Spiderman version   I hope he is replaced   Tobey Maquire played the role much better  The only difference in 2021 is the special effects,negative,positive
Looking back at it this movie did not live up to its hype For me I feel like it lacked heart and creativity I know that it struggled during pandemic but I just cant see it as a masterpiece because for me that title belongs and always will belong to Sam Raimis SpiderMan 2 ,negative,negative

Movie was alright They literally only fought the big villains and no smaller criminals which i found very boring The CGI looked crap at some points like when jamie foxx's arms looked like rubberplastic while he was hovering in the air I feel like tobey and andrew should have gotten out of the portals in a more dramatic way Its for sure a movie that has to be watched but for me i will only watch it once since it really feeled like that all the money went into getting all 3 spidermans together This movie all in all felt like an excuse to bring all 3 together to grab some cash There was literally no point in jake gyllenhal revealing the identity of spidermanlike at all,negative,positive

The story has no logic three parallel universes the characters who were killed at the moment before death were transferred through a portal to the same universe and they have the possibility to repair themselves so that they do not die if electro transferred at the moment of death and everyone else to that portal how did gwen die When parallel events occur in similar ways When The Amazing SpiderMan says I lost Gwen that was my MJ she died 8 years ago And events are like parallel worlds This part changes the fate of the people from the previous parts it changes the story The best Spiderman was Amazing Everyone saw that the evil characters died as well as the good ones doesn't the fate of the killed people change if the fight is not over if it ends in Spiderman no back home these characters become good when they return to their parallel worlds and Spiderman there is no risk of fighting them if norman died in the first part then spiderman 2 and 3 were filmed for no reason Because the first part is parallel to this universe and Norman was transferred to this universe before his death Dr Octivius is looking for PP of old because he does not know what happened in the moment before he was submerged he was transferred to this universe Where they say the moment the power of the sun was in my palm I was transferred here In my opinion you should have corrected the story and continued filming PP and Gwen Because it is the best season of allbrThis Spiderman is not good,negative,negative

I am currently crying so hard right now This is seriously the most beautiful well put together story ever I cant believe how magical it was That part truly made me shed a tear And especially at a href that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail Oh and we cant forget the conclusion The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history It is a tragedy that this it cant be called a film but a transcendent emotional experience will be inaccessible for most It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics suffering pleasure faith despair It connects with the characters within the viewers individuals suppressed within our own subconscious It stays vibrant fresh and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human Entertaining gripping and simply exhilarating This might be the most impactful piece of art Ive come across in my life and Im definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply this is an absolute masterpiece  I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times it absolutely moved my soul  and I don't think I can ever be the same this bacon has changed my entire mental state  I am now at peace with who I am and what

Originally they were thinking about including more characters from the other movies for this They would've included Kirsten Dunst's MJ Emma Stones' Gwen Rhino from TASM2 Dane DeHaan's Green Goblin from TASM2 and even more of Tom Hardy's Venom Mysterio was actually supposed to be brought in for a battle with Dr Strange I think maybe it could've worked if this story was spilt into two movies like with Infinity War and Endgame With that Part 1 would be more of Tom's movie and it would end with him meeting Tobey and Andrew to get help which would set up the events of the sequel But obviously they couldn't do more than one because of how Sony is currently doing those animated SpiderVerse movies and Across The SpiderVerse is going to be split into two movies themselves I hope Tobey Andrew and Tom make an appearance in Part Two Also it would be really cool that another No Way Home is made with Tobey Andrew and Tom But they should include the other characters that werent included Michelle Jones would meet Mary Jane and could find out how shes married to Tobey and that they are probably parents Mary Jane could inspires Michelle to dye her hair red They would also meet Gwen and find out how she was supposed to go to Oxford and Andrew would have a tearful reunion with her When she goes back home she will avoid her death If TASM3 does happen Shailene Woodley could make an appearance and Gwen will feel around her In addition Kirsten Dunsts MJ will feel weird around Emmas Gwen because of how she didnt get along with Bryce Dallas Howards We could see Dane DeHaans Harry get cured from his disease and he will be sorry for everything he did Rhino could make an appearance but in a real battle this time Maybe Topher Grace and Tom Hardy could battle It would be interesting to see what both of their symbiotes could do with each other I dont know if James Franco would return but it would be a touching reunion with him Tobey and Kirsten on screen Maybe Vulture Shocker and Mysterio could appear too And since Vulture is teamed up with Morbius I guess characters from the SSU would appear if Vulture is telling people Peters identity,neutral,negative

Istg the amount of hype bro,positive,neutral
The movie is already 1 year old It definitely shows a sad face of our reality anyone whom is accused of something or under suspicion people are ready to turn on them and get violent brPeter is facing a true struggle is it true everywhere SpiderMan goes chaos and calamity ensues Whatever damage is left behind we have to pick up the pieces brCan you actually fix someone we should give people second chances to start over rather than meet our fate a simple solution isnt the only solution can we do more than expect disappointment therefore avoiding disappointment morality isnt a weakness revenge never makes anything better brAfter 20 years I can safely say this was absolutely worth that wait  Intense action the stakes are the highest they've ever been for SpiderMan and there's a ton of heavy emotional beats I wasn't ready for brTerrific to see past actors come back from previous franchises and lots of nods to the culture of the character even Green Goblin gets more exploration trying to suppress his dual personality but with little success plus Electro gets a good course correction since his birth and Doc Ock is offered a way out without being power hungry with his hubris more sympathy for these individuals rather than being straight up bad guys brMore stuff centering about rehabilitation as opposed to just jailing up people  I wish more of the villains were explored further  but the film delivers enough for longtime fans plus it's the best acted from Tom Holland as this current version brHe really does bring the central core of the character full circle with sorrow guilt regret and being responsible brLove how Ned gets to be more proactive next to MJ too brThe climax is astounding visually and emotionally  I am curious how future movies will benefit from this now that Marvel and Sony are finally collaborating  brThe movie is about looking backwards but learning to go forwards and there will always be consequences trying to change things or set things right not to mention showing the test of what it means to be a hero let alone what it costs sacrifice and sparing others pain brDirector Jon Watts closes this cycle of SpiderMan movies with quite a jolt not forgetting the human drama exciting fights and embracing the colorful fun of the comics brBest movie of 2021 and one of the best SpiderMan movies period,positive,positive

I miss the hype,positive,negative
 the acting  special effects were great  With that being said I did not enjoy the movie I thought the story line could have been a lot better  I dont like the fact his aunt was murdered because of his choice  I dont like the fact the writer set an example that is not realistic  The moral of the movie for me was if you are being robbed by a criminal give the criminal the keys to your car to drive away with   open your door and let the criminal in your home and assist them with stealing your property If your family gets hurt in the process its ok because you must be kind all the time even if you are being violently attacked are robbed STUPID CONCEPT ,negative,negative

Trailer 3 minutes I always feel that bad movies known from long trailers,negative,negative
I just watched this for the first time 2 days ago Honestly got fed up of the superhero stuff But that's all tv has on it these days so got sucked in It was excellent thought I'd come read comments and realized that some many don't feel the same  So decided to comment to put things in perspective See i saw the first spidermen in cinema There was hype All we had before this eas batman and superman movies Xmen also just took off These were cartoons that we grew up with that shaped us in more ways than we knew so it was important to us to see these characters come to life on the big screen brTobey was our first spiderman We didn't have internet like we do now with data and cellphones so for us he just vanished And was replaced by Andrew And then 2 movies later Another spiderman  Each director told us a story In their own way And because they each remembered things differently There were differences  And we were asked to forget the previous movies Because it was like a slate being wiped clean and irrelevant to the current happenings  This was a breaking of the fourth wall for us  By having them break the third The only other time this happened XMen first class mystique   So yes There was a great deal of hype Because then unlike now we didn't expect that it would have been the last time for us to see either of them as spiderman again  brStated another way Imagine 70 years from now A reboot of James Cameron's titanic But the old lady telling the story is kate Winslet  Or 19 years from now An ironman reboot With Robert Downey Jr  Or perhaps my best example yet A strange world where heath ledger and Joachin Phoenix square off against keaton and  kilmer Or all the bond actors together in one film See It's impossible   With this film Hollywood did the impossible brOh And fyi It's the XMen and spiderman that made enough money and got the MCU happening Because it was profitable and people wanted more  Compared to hulk green lantern and a lot of other shitty superhero movies along the way Yes lantern is DC but my point is the real world isn't isolated like that They're all one big genre  Goblin Oc Those characters died on us And we felt it So to see them in the ORIGINAL format  We fans were done justicea proper homage They brought 3 generations of spiderman fans together in a way I don't see happening anytime soon until XMen finds it's way,positive,positive
